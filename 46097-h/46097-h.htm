<p>The Author desires to thank the Proprietors
of the <cite>Sydney Morning Herald</cite> for permission
to incorporate in this book the "Trooper
Bluegum" articles which originally appeared in
that journal, and the Proprietors of the <cite>Passing
Show</cite> for permission to reprint the verses "Anzac,"
by "Argent." He desires to thank many friends
in Australia, previously unknown to him, for
kind letters sent to him whilst fighting (and writing)
in the trenches on Gallipoli; and also that
little band of Red Cross workers in country towns
of New South Wales who, in appreciation of his
stories from the Front, knitted him socks and
Balaclava caps and scarves to ward off the winter
winds. Especially does he desire to thank his
esteemed colleague on the <cite>Herald</cite>, Mr. Farmer
Whyte, for valuable assistance, generously rendered,
in the preparation and arrangement of the
contents of this book for publication in their
present form.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Among the legacies, good and evil, tragic and
inspiring, which the Great War of Nations
is destined to hand down to posterity, one of the
most valuable and permanent in its influence
will be the <span class="smcap">Literature</span> which this Armageddon
will have brought forth. In that fountain
of knowledge the world will have command of
vast stores of intellectual treasure&mdash;History,
Poetry, the Drama, Philosophy, Fiction&mdash;which
will continue to fascinate, to appal, to instruct,
so long as books are read and the crimes, the
virtues, the calamities and follies of mankind
are subjects of human interest.</p>

<p>Such a literature, sanctified by the blood of
millions of heroes&mdash;the world's best manhood&mdash;and
by sacrifices and sufferings that have literally
staggered humanity, will comprehend and crystallize
events, compared with which all former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
world-cataclysms will seem but passing ripples on
the ocean of life.</p>

<p>While in its inception and progress this greatest
breach of the world's peace has exhibited a section
of mankind as hardly at all removed from fiends
incarnate, it has also shown men inspired by the
highest virtues and striving for the loftiest ideals;
and it has produced women only a little lower than
the angels. Thus we seem to see, in all its naked
deformities as well as in its beauty and majesty,
the very soul of nations.</p>

<p>Not to "the future historian," but to whole
battalions of historians will it fall to relate the
tragic story of this mighty conflict, to pass judgment
on the guilty authors of it, while giving to
valour and the champions of right their due.
They will have ample material to work upon, and
they should have little difficulty in sifting out
from the mass of evidence before them that
which is true from that which is false, certainly
as to the real instigators of the rupture.</p>

<p>As to the conduct and prosecution of this war
of big battles, the fighting over (and under)
thousands of miles of land and ocean, and in the
air, the work of the armies of war correspondents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
has been, on the whole, worthy of the highest
traditions of that dangerous class of literary
work. In many respects it has even surpassed
that of the great war chroniclers of the past, from
Russell and Forbes onwards, who have shed lustre
on British and foreign journalism. The old race
of war correspondents has passed away, but their
spirit survives. A new school has been founded.
They who graduate in it must accommodate
themselves to new conditions of warfare, wherein
the Censor plays his part.</p>

<p>To the work of these writers the historians of
the war will be largely indebted for their material
in relating the operations of the opposing hosts.
The private letters of soldiers throw a clear light
on minor phases of the engagements in which they
took part. These provide intensely interesting
reading, too often of a painfully absorbing kind,
their authors the eyewitnesses of and actors in
the scenes they describe.</p>

<p>The "Trooper Bluegum" contributions to the
literature of the war were written for and have
appeared in the <cite>Sydney Morning Herald</cite>. They
are the work of a Sydney native, a trained
journalist, who for the time gave up a responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
position on the literary staff of that journal to
enlist as a trooper and serve at the front. As a
military writer his reputation had been well on
in the making when General Sir Ian Hamilton,
a few years ago, came to Australia to inspect the
Commonwealth Forces. Here came his chance
as a military critic and descriptive writer on
training operations. For his insight into the
man&oelig;uvres and sham fight engagements of our
troops, and his descriptions in the <cite>Sydney Morning
Herald</cite> of the important movements under Sir
Ian Hamilton's observation, the future "Trooper
Bluegum" earned the special commendation of that
distinguished British General. From the rank
of trooper the author of these sketches speedily
rose in the service, obtained a commission, and,
as Second Lieutenant, was chosen orderly to
Colonel (afterwards Brigadier-General) Ryrie,
Commander of the Second Light Horse Brigade.
Soon after landing at the scene of operations at
Gallipoli, he was promoted to First Lieutenant.</p>

<p>It was just before Christmas, close on five
months after war was declared, that the Expeditionary
Force which included General Ryrie's
Brigade sailed from Sydney. Nearly the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Trooper Bluegum's descriptions of the operations
in the Anzac sphere were written in dugouts between
intervals of the fighting, often with shells
screaming overhead, shrapnel bursting, and bullets
flying about him.</p>

<p>A feature of the descriptions in this book is the
clear light thrown on the rollicking yet unconquerable
spirit of the Australian soldier in action,
on his never-failing good humour and love of
fun even in the face of death in any form, his
amenableness to discipline, his cheerful, patient
endurance of hardship, and his fine contempt of
danger whenever and wherever confronting him.
Here is seen the Australian (his New Zealand
brother in all respects his exact prototype) in the
full integrity of his young manhood.</p>

<p>Whence came these qualities in a branch of an
immortal race bred to peaceful pursuits? The
analytical psychologist may not unprofitably
try his hand at explaining. The root principle is
that the fighting spirit which to the astonishment
of the whole world, flashed out on Gaba
Tepe heights, was in the blood of the race, fostered
in the schools, on the playgrounds, and sustained
by undying attachment to the great Empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
whose flag is the symbol for all that free men hold
dear.</p>

<p>This book is a narrative, with sidelights and
commentary, of the operations of the Australian
Imperial Expeditionary Forces, from the training
encampment at Holdsworthy to the time when,
chastened but still unconquered, the heroic band
of Australians, or rather the remnant that was
left of them, returned from Anzac after the most
glorious failure in the annals of war.</p>

<p>RIDING TESTS&mdash;THE SOLDIER'S OATH&mdash;SIR IAN
HAMILTON&mdash;MOUNTED PARADE&mdash;BUSHMEN
AND CITY MEN ON TRIAL&mdash;LIGHT HORSE
WAR SONG</p></div>


<p class="mt2">"Trooper Bluegum, you're next."</p>

<p>I stepped forward. A hundred volunteers
had been marched down from Victoria
Barracks, Sydney, and were undergoing the
riding test prior to being drafted into the Australian
Light Horse.</p>

<p>"Mount and ride," said the sergeant.</p>

<p>I leaped on the bare back of a hog-maned colt.
Three other candidates were already mounted
waiting for the signal. One was a Sydney
"bushman" and was obviously nervous. The
other two were bushmen from Riverina and the
Hunter River and they grinned confidently.</p>

<p>"Cross this flat," continued the sergeant;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
"leap the bog, jump the sod wall, gallop to that
marker, and return."</p>

<p>Some fool orderly gave my mount a crack
over the back with a rope and away we galloped.
The flat was easy, though I had not ridden bare-backed
for some time. The bog offered no resistance
and we leaped the sod wall neck and neck.
Then the horses wanted to bolt and they took
some stopping. Anyhow, the first half of the
test was safely through.</p>

<p>The Sydney bushman was looking more at ease.
The others grinned expansively. "That's dead
easy," said the man from Narrandera. "Call that
a riding test?"</p>

<p>The return signal was given, and the quartette
started off. All went well till the water jump
loomed ahead. Here half a dozen yelling orderlies
were posted to spur on the chargers to the leap.
The three bushmen cleared the obstacle with
hardly a splash, but disaster was in store for the
City bushman. Right on the brink the horse
stopped dead and the hapless rider was shot with
catapultic force head first into the bog, amid
roars of merriment from the assembled army.
We three countrymen "passed," were promptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
marshalled with the horsemen, and marched to
the doctor's for medical examination. The City
bushman was sent to "the gravel-crushers."</p>

<p>In a huge marquee in Rosebery Park were a
score of virile young Australians stripped for the
fray. Sun-tanned bushmen they were for the
most part, lean and wiry, with muscles rippling
over their naked shoulders. Splendid specimens&mdash;strong
but not too heavy, rarely topping thirteen
stone, for all the heavier men had been sent to
the infantry. But these were ideal Light Horsemen.</p>

<p>"Bluegum forward."</p>

<p>I stood, and the sergeant ran the tape over me:
Weight, 11 stone; height, 5 feet ten; chest, 37,
expanded 41; age 34; beauty spots and identification
marks, none; eyes, brown; hair, brown;
religion, Presbyterian.</p>

<p>Then the doctor got busy; tapping here, sounding
there, finally with a word of approval sending
me over to the sight specialist. There was a
jumble of letters of various sizes set before me,
and finally, with a score of others satisfactory in
wind and limb, I was sent on to the adjutant.
My name, age, occupation, next-of-kin, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
essential details were recorded. Then we were
lined up to swear allegiance.</p>

<p>On the flat the volunteers were still doing the
riding test, with hundreds of onlookers keenly
enjoying it. Each time some luckless aspirant
for fame and glory was precipitated into the bog
the crowd roared with delight, and when he
emerged, mud-bespattered and crestfallen, the
hilarity of the bushmen knew no bounds. Pointed
advice was hurled at the failures, and they were
urged to join the "gravel-crushers," which most
of them did.</p>

<p>For a couple of hours the fun continued, and
with the end of the day another hundred rough-riders
were drawn up, passed and enlisted ready
for anything and everything. One by one we
went forward and took the oath.</p>

<p>The sun was just setting over the western rim of
dear old Sydney town when my turn came. The
clouds were all gold and rose and amethyst, and
the whole scene was as peaceful as could be. The
First Light Horse Regiment&mdash;in fine fettle, ready
at a moment's notice to sail for Europe&mdash;cantering
gaily back to camp, reminded us that the
nation was in a state of war, that the empire was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
engaged in a life and death struggle, and that on
the issue of the great conflict depended the fate
of Australia. And we of the Sixth Regiment were
to make good the "wastage of war."</p>

<p>So, solemnly, I kissed the Book and swore this
oath: "I, James Bluegum, swear that I will
well and truly serve our Sovereign Lord the King
in the Australian Imperial Force from September
1914 until the end of the war, and a further period
of four months thereafter, unless sooner lawfully
discharged, dismissed, or removed therefrom;
and that I will resist His Majesty's enemies and
cause His Majesty's peace to be kept and maintained;
and that I will in all matters appertaining
to my service faithfully discharge my duty according
to law. So help me God."</p>

<p>I was a Soldier of the King!</p>

<p>Once more we were lined up and marched away
to the quartermaster. Each man was given a
waterproof sheet, a pair of blankets, a knife, fork,
spoon, tin plate, and pannikin. We were to form
part of the Second Light Horse Brigade, and
being minus tents we were relegated to the stables.
We raided the straw store, made beds, and lay
upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not ours to go with the first lot of heroes
to take part in the Great War. Most of us had
waited till the Germans got within cannon shot
of Paris. Then we "butted in." We were
selected to supply the wastage&mdash;that was all.
If we could not be the first in the firing-line, it
was something to know that we would take the
place of the men who were killed or wounded&mdash;all
of us, the man from Narrandera, in Riverina,
the man from Hunter River, the men from out-back
everywhere, Trooper Bluegum among them,
all whistling merrily "Soldiers of the King, my
Boys!"</p>

<p>We of the Light Horse started with many things
in our favour. We reckoned we could ride as
well as, if not better than, any body of men in
the world, for we could ride almost as soon as we
could walk. Also, we were pretty good shots.
Many were Rifle Club men. All had done a bit
of shooting in the bush, for dingoes and kangaroos
and wallabies are not yet extinct in Australia.
So half of our lesson was learned before
we started. The drill and the discipline only
remained. We did not mind the drill, but the
discipline was irksome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a recognized flaw in our military make-up,
this want of discipline. Sir Ian Hamilton, when
he visited Australia in 1914, found the colonial
compulsory trainees much more amenable to
discipline than he expected. But the militia
are caught young. We of the Expeditionary
Force were a little bit too old to rid ourselves
readily of the habits of the bush, and adapt ourselves
to the rigid routine of military life. But
perhaps it would come in time.</p>

<p>It is a strange world, my masters! I have
before me as I write a copy of a Sydney newspaper,
dated May 21, 1914, giving the report
and recommendations made by General Sir Ian
Hamilton in Australia, and it is headed "If War
Came." And there I read of the Australian
Infantry: "I have now seen the greater portion
of the Australian Infantry, and I wish very much
I could transplant 10,000 of these young soldiers
to Salisbury Plain. They would do the croakers
good and make them less frightened of other
nations, who have no overseas children getting
ready to lend them a hand. The majority of the
non-commissioned officers and men are still very
young, but they are full of intelligence and grit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
On at least two occasions I have seen brigades
tested severely, once by heat and heavy marching,
the other time by floods and mud. In each
case the men made light of their trying experiences,
treating them as an excellent joke."</p>

<p>It was of the same men that the same man was
to write but a few short months afterwards:
"They have created for themselves an imperishable
record of military virtue."</p>

<p>But it is a long, long way to &mdash;&mdash;. Day after
day we performed the tiresome evolutions of
troop and squadron drill on foot, for the horses
were not yet ready. We mastered the mysteries
of sections right, form troop, form squadron
column; then day after day we engaged in rifle
drill&mdash;"stand at ease," "attention," "slope
arms," "present arms," till our arms ached.
Then we fixed our bayonets, and in fancy
bayoneted thousands of "kultured" Germans.</p>

<p>But it was not till the horses came that we
really felt like Light Horsemen.</p>

</div></div>

<p>It was not child's play tackling those horses.
Some of the kind-hearted station folk in the
backblocks had sent down some wild warrigals of
the West; bucking brumbies that beat the band;
old outlaws off the grass that the station hands
could never master. But Colonel Cox ("Fighting
Charlie" we called him) had in his command
some of the crack rough-riders of Australia.
And it was a joy to see these men tackle the
outlaws. There were Crouch of Wagga, McDonald
of Barrington, Whiteley of Wellington, Bullock
of Melbourne, Sievewright of Gunnedah, Kennedy
of Gloucester, Rex Moffatt of Goulburn,
Harry Heath of Moree, and a score of others.
Nearly every man in the regiment could sit a
buck, or puff nonchalantly at his pipe while his
mount pigrooted merrily. So when the wild
horses were led forth there were hundreds volunteering
for the honour of riding the rebels. One
after another the horses were saddled up, and
while the regiment cheered itself hoarse, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
was enacted again and again the old-time struggle
for mastery. There were plunging and reefing
and rooting and sidling and rearing and bucking,
as the panting chargers swung this way and that
in vain endeavour to dislodge the riders. But
the bush boys stuck to the saddles as the Old
Man of the Sea stuck to Sindbad the Sailor, and
one after another the bucking brumbies were
broken and led away.</p>

<p>Then came the first mounted parade. A
squadron of Scots Greys or Life Guards might
have kept better line; they might probably
have wheeled with more order and precision
for each troop here had a few half-broken colts
prancing and dancing all over the shop, but&mdash;well,
somebody said that these troops would
compare favourably with any body of mounted
infantry in the world. Certain it is that when,
one fine day, the officer commanding, Colonel Cox,
accompanied by the Brigadier, Colonel Ryrie, made
a careful inspection of the whole regiment, every
one from the officer commanding down was satisfied.
And certain it is that we sang the Australian
Light Horse war song with unusual enthusiasm&mdash;</p>

<p class="mt2">"Who's the Jonah?" That was mild.</p>

<p>"Curse our luck!" That was
moderate.</p>

<p>But when Trooper Newman said, "To hell
with the ship!" most of us felt that he showed
a proper appreciation of the position.</p>

<p>For days and days we had ploughed our way
across the Indian Ocean, and, as the long leagues
in front joined their comrades behind, we felt
that we were getting farther and farther from
sunny New South Wales. But we were steering
straight for Ceylon, and looking forward with
keen anticipation to a few days of the picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Orient. Some of the impressionable young subalterns
were singing "Cingalee, Cingalee, I have
lost my heart to a Cingalee." All of us for the
last day or two had been taking station on the
forecastle-head, shading our eyes and gazing into
the misty horizon for the first glimpse of the
enchanted isle.</p>

<p>But alas for hopes unfulfilled! Ceylon's
spicy breezes, after all, were not to fan our
fevered brows, neither were Cingalese to minister
to our need with "tea in the morning, tea in
the evening, tea in the afternoon." Early in the
morning of January 12 we got word that a
special squadron of three ships was to be detached
from the main fleet, and with Colonel
Ryrie in command, steam straight to Aden.
So we stood on deck and swore unrestrainedly.</p>

<p>However, there was still corn in Egypt, and we
would be the first to get there. Besides, there
was quite a chance that there was something
doing&mdash;a Dervish expedition or an Arab raid
might be on, and we would have the laugh at the
other chaps if we could have first smack at the
unspeakable Turk. So by the time the bugle
sounded for the usual inspection, we were all in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
high good humour again. The three liners swung
out from the convoy and, cheering a farewell,
were soon steaming westward. One after another
the transports dipped down under the horizon,
and soon a few grey smudges on the rim of the
ocean were all that remained to remind us of the
fleet.</p>

<p>We had seen no land since leaving Australia.
It seemed such a long time. So when, a couple
of days later, somebody shouted "Land-ho,"
we rushed to the nearest post of advantage. Far
away to eastward, like a green pimple on the
blue face of the waters, was a tiny little island.
In an hour we were abreast of it&mdash;Minikoi,
surely one of the islands of the blessed; how
green it looked after the everlasting blue of the
Indian Ocean; from end to end it was covered
with cocoa-nut palm. A long line of snow-white
surf beat upon the sandy shore. Gleaming in the
tropical sun was the lighthouse&mdash;a silent sentinel.
And in the offing were a score of picturesque
canoes, and dhows, with brown hempen sails,
managed by gaudily-dressed islanders, who seemed
rather annoyed that the transports did not stop
and purchase their fruit-offerings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing by the rugged Socotra, we soon sighted
the mountainous southern coast of Arabia, and
by midday on January 20 we were focussing our
binoculars on the picturesque gate of the Indian
Ocean, Aden. Curious it is how Britain has
secured all the great strategical points of the
world&mdash;Gibraltar, Suez, Aden, Singapore, Thursday
Island, the Cape of Good Hope, and the rest.
And one has only to see Aden, with its rocky
peaks piercing the skyline, to realize how strong
it is, and how futile would be any effort to capture
it. For all the defences of Aden seem to
be hewn out of solid granite.</p>

<p>No sooner had we got anchored in the harbour
than the <i>Suevic</i> was surrounded by swarms of
boats, in which were crowded Asiatics of all
descriptions yelling like demons in wild anxiety
to sell their wares. Then the colliers came alongside
and proceeded to coal. Scores of thin,
undersized, but wiry Arabs did the work, and as
they loaded the bunkers they kept up a perpetual
yelling and singing, and the weird cacophony
lasted all through the night.</p>

<p>Aden is a curious mixture of the Orient and
the Occident. In the streets silent Arabs stalk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
along with camels, and Europeans buzz around
in automobiles. One section of the port belongs
to the Asiatics; the other is all Western. Arab
dhows float across the harbour and steam tugs
scurry hither and yon. One section of the town
has thatched roofs; the other is all galvanized
iron. And one of the natives sang us "Songs
of Araby." They yelled harshly for baksheesh
all the while. Clad in their own coloured loin
cloths, or in discarded khaki tunics from the
Force, they were a motley tatterdemalion crowd.
Here East and West met&mdash;but did not mingle.</p>

<p>We had had no word of news for weeks.
So we eagerly searched for the newspapers, and
demanded news of the outer world. The war
was still on. The Allies were more than holding
their own. Here was news indeed!&mdash;news such
as <cite>The Transport Trumpeter</cite> (published aboard
the <i>Suevic</i>) had never heard of. Yet we loved
that little paper of ours on the transport&mdash;"a
little thing, but our own." If it lacked news it
did not lack reporters whose imagination made up
for the deficiency. We were all reporters for <cite>The
Transport Trumpeter</cite>. Even I. And I am
wondering to this day about a certain curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
coincidence connected with one of my painstaking
efforts. I wrote on December 28, 1914, a skit on
Lissauer's "Hymn of Hate," and Arthur Adam's
reply to it&mdash;"My Friend, Remember." A month
later I got the Sydney <cite>Bulletin</cite>, and there I saw
almost exactly the same article with the same
excerpts from each poem. They were probably
written on the same day, a thousand miles or so
apart. You who delve into the mysterious, will
you explain?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Egypt! What memories! What life here!
What a quest we have set out upon! What
Alexanders are we!</p>

<p>I feel the blood coursing through my veins
as I have never felt it before. I live in the present,
but the past stands up before me. Dead
kings and emperors pass in endless succession.
Libyans and Ethiopians pass by, Assyrians and
Macedonians, Babylonians and Persians, Romans,
Arabs, Turks and Mamelukes&mdash;and French and
British. Great names are sprinkled over the
pages of Egypt, from Menes, the first king, and
Rameses the Second, down to the present day.
Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander the Great, Constantine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Saladin and Napoleon, Mohammed Ali
and Kitchener have all left their mark on the
Nile Delta. What history! and here are we&mdash;soldiers
of King George V, from Australia&mdash;treading
this historic ground, making new history.
Nebuchadnezzar knew us not. Constantine
never dreamed&mdash;and they used to dream
dreams in those days&mdash;that from a land he knew
not of would one day come armed men marching
on the wonderful city he built.</p>

<p>Nor did I, nor did any of us, know it&mdash;well, not
yet.</p>

<p>I know what it means to see the blush clouds
beating the night shades back in the van of a
golden morning, but there is a quality of richness
about the sunrises of Egypt that Australia
lacks. Egypt has the glint of gold, the cloud
ridges of rosy red, the blaze of amethyst and opal.
So also has the Australian sky. But Australia
has no pyramids. The first beams of the sun in
this land tip the cones of the age-old pyramids,
and soon these drab giants shine like molten copper.
Then the sky turns all gold, and the scene
is duplicated in the placid bosom of the ancient
Nile, which skirts our camp. In the murky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
distance the desert is shrouded in a misty haze
which has the same blue that one sees in the
distance on the Blue Mountains of New South
Wales, but once the sun is fairly above the
horizon, the brilliant transformation scene dissolves
itself into a glaring white light that lasts
till sunset. Then the morning's glory is reenacted
with softer tones and a riot of colour
that I can never describe.</p>

<p>Then, as the Pyramids of Gizeh were due
west from Ma'adi, we always saw these giant
triangles sharply silhouetted against the red
horizon. They looked like little toy tents, yet
when alongside them their magnitude staggered
us.</p>

<p>The day was so hot that helmets were necessary.
Some "went down" under the fierce rays of the
sun, but there were some with us who said it was
not hot at all. They spoke of the sun-baked
Western Plains. They spoke of Bourke. They
spoke of Northern Queensland. But they wore
helmets, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Yet was Ma'adi, for all its heat, a joy to the
senses. If we had the everlasting desert wilderness
on one side, we also had the oasis of Ma'adi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
on the other. The irrigationist has caused the
desert hereabout to blossom as the rose, and
Ma'adi is like an English village, with gracious
gardens and green, luscious fields and rippling
canals.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the blue of the desert haze that
is like that of the Blue Mountains. And here and
there one finds other touches of old Australia.
I went out one day to Sir Alexander Baird's
beautiful mansion near Zeitoun, and there I
saw some fine old gums and wattles; and it just
felt like home.</p>

<p>And the people, how kind they all were!
Even the shopkeepers did all they could to make
us feel at home. "Special Australian Shop,"
"Australian Soldiers' Rendezvous"&mdash;signs like
these met us at every turn. Especially grateful
did we feel for the warning one Cairo shopkeeper
gave us: "Don't go elsewhere to be cheated,
Australians. Come here!" Nor shall we ever
forget the laborious days and nights which that
shopkeeper who put out the sign must have
spent in mastering our language&mdash;"English and
French spoken; Australian understood."</p>

<p>Truth to tell, the Australian soldiers were as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
shower of gold to the thirsty Cairo traders. They
all loved the Australians. We scattered money
far and wide&mdash;till we had none left. We threw
piastres to the winds&mdash;thinking nothing of them,
they were such little coins&mdash;till we had none
left. From morning till night we distributed
largess. It was baksheesh everywhere and all
the time. Whichever way we turned we found
somebody dangling something in front of our
eyes&mdash;ready to sacrifice it for our sake. Even
Trooper Newman, who previously had expressed
his best wishes to the ship, comes up to me with
a gaudy handkerchief he has just bought for ten
piastres. It has King George in one corner,
Kitchener in another, French in another, Jellicoe
in another, and generals and admirals and dukes
and earls all round it. "It may be the only
chance I'll get," says he, "of poking my nose
into high society."</p>

<p>There came one day a very wise Egyptian&mdash;one
whom I know as a Freemason&mdash;and he gave
a valuable scarab, mounted in a gold ring, to
Major Lynch. There was no doubt that the wise
man valued it, and there is no doubt that he left
an impression on Major Lynch. It is a talisman
and a protection to the owner, but it has deadly
powers. Nothing can harm the owner so long
as he has it in his possession, and the owner can
shrivel up an enemy by merely pointing at him
and muttering incantations&mdash;just as the Northern
Territory natives in Australia can <em>will</em> an enemy
to die by pointing a bone at him. Major Lynch
lost no time in putting the scarab to the test.
There was a very troublesome native who used
to bother him several times a day about things
that don't matter, and the day after the wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Egyptian had made his presentation the major
pointed at the native and muttered a powerful
Australian incantation. Since then the native

<p>A dragoman wanted to sell me some scarabs.</p>

<p>"You like fine scarab?"</p>

<p>"Piastres! Ach! No, no, no! Five <em>pounds</em>!"</p>

<p>"Five pounds a dozen!"</p>

<p>"No, no, no! Five pounds for one beautiful
scarab."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ha ha!"</p>

<p>"Not ha! ha! It is three thousand years old!
Time of Rameses II."</p>

<p>"Too old. Got any nice <em>new</em> ones?"</p>

<p>"No, no. Not <em>new</em>. Old&mdash;very valuable&mdash;three
thousand years!"</p>

<p>"Too old. Show me a new one."</p>

<p>"You no understand. Very old, very valuable,
out of tombs in pyramid."</p>

<p>"Any more there?"</p>

<p>"No more&mdash;all gone."</p>

<p>"Oh, well I oughtn't to take them from you."</p>

<p>"Yes, you take. I sell you for five pounds."</p>

<p>"Not me."</p>

<p>"Yes, you. <em>Four</em> pounds!"</p>

<p>"Try again."</p>

<p>"Three pounds ten."</p>

<p>"Once more."</p>

<p>"Two pounds ten. Finish."</p>

<p>"No business; <em>Imshi</em>."</p>

<p>Then the old man went away, muttering
angrily in his beard because I would not pay
three golden sovereigns for a little stone that
looked like a petrified beetle. Even if it had been
genuine&mdash;even if it <em>was</em> three thousand years old&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
would have thought it a shame for him to take
the money. But the reputation these "gyppies"
have for faking antiquities and curios made me
sceptical. In the Cairo Museum are genuine
thousand-year-old relics from the tombs and
pyramids, and the natives copy them and sell
the replicas as the genuine article.</p>

<p>When I was leaving the Museum one afternoon
a dragoman shuffled up to me in a mysterious
kind of way and thrust an antiquated statuette
into my hand. "Five shillings," he whispered
hoarsely. He wanted me to think it genuine,
and, I suppose, stolen. (Even honest people
don't mind being "receivers" when they can get
a genuine relic of antiquity cheap.) I examined
it with the concentrated gaze of a connoisseur
in Egyptology, scratched it with my knife, and
then exclaimed, "Bah, rubbish! One piastre."
And the old sinner cried, "Yes, yes," and put his
hand out eagerly for the money.</p>

<p>And all this time we were "training for the
front." We did not know when we were likely
to leave for the front, nor what front it would be,
but already some of the Australians and New
Zealanders had been in a fight. That was before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
we came. Egypt had been "invaded"; there
had been a fight at El Kantara, some prisoners
had been taken, and then the invaders turned
their heads north and eastward, folding their
tents, like the Arabs they are, and silently stealing
away. The Great Invasion of which Kaiser
Wilhelm had dreamed for months had simply
petered out.</p>

<p>I am no historian&mdash;I write only of the little
things I care about&mdash;but I would be no Australian
if I failed to mention this invasion which some
of the Australians helped to stamp out. It was
almost inconceivable that the "thorough-going,
methodical" Germans could have started an
army of 75,000 men across the desert, sent only
25,000 of them into action, and then decamped.
But that is what happened.</p>

<p>Although the Australians and New Zealanders
saw but little of the actual fighting, they played
no unimportant part in the scheme of things.
The seeds of disloyalty and discord had been
assiduously sown by German spies and agents
all over Egypt. The so-called Nationalist party
was intriguing to oust the British and facilitate
the entry of the Turks. It was confidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
anticipated by the German wire-pullers that the
moment the invaders appeared on the Canal
the Egyptians and Arabs would rise <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i>
and drive the British into the sea. Drastic
measures were taken months ahead for dealing
with the English residents in Cairo and elsewhere.
Everything seemed to be going nicely for the
plotters. Obvious signs of disaffection were
noticed all over Lower Egypt. The British were
so few; the German-Arab-Turkish combination
was so strong. It only wanted a favourable
opportunity to fire the train.</p>

<p>Then the Australians arrived.</p>

<p>There may be a tendency on our part to
exaggerate the influence of the Australian and
New Zealand troops on the Egyptian situation;
but there is not the slightest doubt that the
presence of 50,000 Colonial troops had a wonderfully
steadying effect on the disaffected natives.
They suddenly became loyal again. All talk of
sedition ceased. The best-laid schemes of the
German plotters went "agley."</p>

<p>One could not help contrasting this large force
from Australia and New Zealand&mdash;a force that
was to be doubled and trebled ere long&mdash;with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
little force of 500 men which William Bede Dalley,
Australian Orator and Patriot, sent from New
South Wales to the Sudan just thirty years
before. It spoke not only of the wonderful
growth in population of Britain's Dominions of
the South, but it was a living proof that the
years had only served to cement the bonds of
love and loyalty that bind the grand old Mother
land to her Oversea Dominions. The rising
in India, the intention of the Australians to
proclaim their independence the moment when
Britain found herself in peril&mdash;where were they?
Where now was the "disintegration" of the
British Empire which the German Emperor and
his War Lords had so confidently predicted?</p>

<p>With Cairo and the Nile safe, General Wilson
was able to deal effectively with the invaders.
Towards the latter end of January, Northern
Sinai was overrun with them. From a couple
of captured Shawishes of the 75th Turkish
Regiment I learned that the staff arrangements
by the German officers were excellent. Everything
had been foreseen and provided for&mdash;or
nearly everything. Water was available at each
stage of the journey across the desert. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
boats and pontoons were dragged by oxen and
camels along the caravan route from Kosseima,
El Arish, and Nekl. A few six-inch guns were
also transported to the Canal. To supplement
the Turkish force on its south-westerly march
all the pilgrims and Bedouins met with were
pressed into service and rifles were given to them.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of January 28 that the
initial conflict took place at Kantara. A reconnoitring
party from Bir El Dueidar attacked
the British outposts but was repulsed, our losses
being only one officer and one soldier killed and
five Gurkhas wounded. Further south, near
Suez, a nocturnal demonstration by the Turks
merely served to prove the alertness of the defenders,
though unfortunately two of our air
scouts met with disaster. Their aeroplane came
down outside our lines, and on returning on foot
they were both shot dead by our own Indian
patrols. The pity of it.</p>

<p>The main attack developed on the night of
February 2-3, and a determined effort was made
to cross the Canal at several points. A number
of boats, each carried by forty men, were silently
hurried to the front. A small force attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Kantara, but after losing twenty-one killed,
twenty-five wounded and thirty-six prisoners,
they decamped. Later on they renewed the
attack from the south, with no more success,
for they lost eight men killed, whilst a number
were wounded. Our losses were four killed and
twenty-four wounded.</p>

<p>Meantime a more vigorous assault was made at
Toussoum to pierce the line just before daybreak.
An infantry attack was followed by artillery
fire, and under cover of the maxims a more
determined effort was made to cross the Canal
by means of boats, rafts, and pontoons. A
shrapnel shell smashed the first boat and killed
several Turks. Other boats followed and met
with a similar fate&mdash;most of their occupants were
killed or drowned. Not a single boat crossed.
About twenty-five men swam across, however.
Four penetrated the lines and escaped to Cairo,
where they subsequently surrendered. The rest
were captured.</p>

<p>Serapeum was attacked about the same time,
and at dawn the battle raged along the Canal
for about two and a half miles. H.M.S. <i>Hardinge</i>
moved up and down the Canal, responding to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
enemy's artillery. Two Turkish shells landed
on our warships, and ten men were wounded.
For a couple of hours the battle raged, and
although the Turks outnumbered the defenders
at Toussoum by ten to one, they were repulsed
all along the line.</p>

<p>Further north, at Ismailia Ferry, the enemy
entrenched 800 yards away, and a battalion of
Turkish infantry (entrenched overnight) opened
fire. But they did little damage. They blazed
away all day, and our casualties were only six
men wounded. Then we drove them off.</p>

<p>So the great Germano-Turkish attack resolved
itself into simultaneous onslaughts at Kantara,
Ismailia, Toussoum and Serapeum; and when
all attacks had failed the guns of the British and
French cruisers and the shore artillery harried
the enemy in their retreat and added considerably
to their losses. Our casualties were only about
twenty killed and 100 wounded. The invaders
lost more than 420 men killed and over 700
prisoners. Their total casualties&mdash;killed, wounded,
and prisoners&mdash;were computed at 3,000.</p>

<p>Yet it was a small thing, after all&mdash;a small
thing when I look back and think of all that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
happened since. But it was the first fight in the
Great War that Australians and New Zealanders
had a hand in.</p>

<p>We of the Light Horse were not in it. We
saw the Turks away on the rim of the desert
horizon; but the enemy attacked where we
were not. We never fired a shot.</p>

BARRAGE&mdash;IRRIGATING THE DELTA&mdash;THE SCOT

BY NIGHT&mdash;A MAGIC OF COLOUR&mdash;"A
SOUND OF REVELRY BY NIGHT"&mdash;THE
"GRANDE FÊTE DU 75."</p></div>


<p class="mt2">Yes, we were biding our time in Cairo; and
I am telling no secrets when I say that
the Australians swore terribly in Cairo. We had
left our happy homes in order to take part in the
war, and here we were burning our heels on the
Egyptian sand&mdash;day after day, week after week.
No wonder many of us, as we tramped along on a
route march to Helwan on the day preceding
Good Friday, said we would prefer to be spending
the day at the Royal Easter Show in Sydney.</p>

<p>On the right of our line of march lay the Nile
with its green strip of verdure on either side, and
a dozen pyramids out westward. The day was
as hot as a furnace. The mirage seemed to
shimmer on the rim of the earth, and horsemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
camels and Bedouins a few miles away seemed to
be floating in the air. Like white wings gliding
up and down the Nile were the triangular sails
of the native dhows&mdash;wonderfully picturesque,
with their tremendous spars that tower into the
sky. At old Cairo there was a veritable forest
of masts. The rudders of these river boats are
huge things, and the noses are painted in gaudy
colours, and are always turned up disdainfully,
as if they had been bumped against a pier.</p>

<p>You had heard of the Plagues of Egypt;
we have seen them, and are able to vouch for the
authenticity of the Scriptures. Instead of hot
cross buns, Easter brought us a plague of locusts.
The entertainment started at about three o'clock
in the afternoon and lasted till after sundown.
Millions and billions and quadrillions of locusts
danced and sang for us. The air was absolutely
full of them, darkening the sun&mdash;big yellow and
brown and black things, mostly about two
inches long. They sounded like thousands of
whirring wheels, and they dropped on the roofs
with a noise like rain. Where they landed they
left everything bare as a bone. All along the
Nile the "gyppies" turned out and banged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
tin cans to drive them off. Here was an invasion,
if you like! The telegraph wires were black
with them&mdash;like long beads. Some of the beautiful
Ma'adi gardens were quite spoilt. These
locusts of Egypt have absolutely no love for
the beautiful&mdash;in fact, the more beautiful a thing
is the more delight do they take in devouring it.</p>

<p>But even a plague of locusts does not last for
ever&mdash;and Egypt does. Egypt the wonderful!
Egypt the kaleidoscopic! No, gentle reader,
do not waste your sympathies on us. It was
tiresome work, marching, training&mdash;training for
the front, which for months never seemed to get
any nearer, and some of "the boys"&mdash;those of
them who were "spoiling for a fight," as the
saying is&mdash;used at times to kick over the traces
and paint the town vermilion; but there are
compensations in Egypt for all who would seek
them. What did it matter that we had no hot
cross buns for Easter, no hard-boiled eggs, no
ling, no salmon? We had omelettes and quail
on toast, and chicken and curry and strawberries
(no cream) and oranges and custard and jelly and
Turkish coffee and Nile fish and pancakes
and fritters and iced butter and beautiful jam and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
marmalade&mdash;and cigars. So we managed to
get "a snack," you see. And I know that I,
for one, had no desire just then to swap places
with any man in Australia.</p>

<p>On Easter Sunday some of us went out to see
the Barrage&mdash;one of the most wonderful works in
Egypt. Mohammed Ali started it to irrigate
the Delta, but his engineers made some mistakes
and the works were looked upon as a white
elephant&mdash;until Britain took charge. Wonderful
the things that Britain does! A board of eminent
engineers examined the whole scheme and decided
that it would cost over £2,000,000 to complete it.
But a Scotsman came along&mdash;Sir Colin Campbell
Scott-Moncrieff&mdash;and he fixed the whole show
up for £1,200,000. Right at the apex of the
Delta triangle they have laid out beautiful
gardens, with lovely flower-beds, canals and
grassy lawns; and it was a treat to rest our tired
eyes on the green grass after the everlasting
sand, sand, sand of the desert.</p>

<p>It was night when we got back to camp. Oh,
those Egyptian nights! The winter cold has
gone, and spring is in the air. The nights are
fine and fair, clear and cloudless, with the moon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
pure silver. The reflections in the Nile are just
wonderful. The huge date palms stand out
sharply from a star-spangled sky that somehow
has a tint of green in its blue. One thinks of
the Arabian Nights. The very street scenes
make one think of them. Motors glide up and
down the streets with rich Syrians, Greeks,
Egyptians, Italians, Frenchmen and Englishmen,
going to the Continental, or to Shepheard's, or to
private entertainments. It is a gorgeous splash
of colour. They had no motor-cars that I remember
in those old Arabian Nights, but the magic
of the thing and the colour of it all were surely
much the same. And the roads of Egypt&mdash;how
beautiful they are!&mdash;clean and smooth as a
billiard table. Are there any finer roads in the
whole world than the Mena road and that to
Heliopolis? Fifty miles an hour is easy. I
sometimes shudder now when I recall the races
that we used to have along those roads at night,
crying "Egre! Egre!"&mdash;Faster! Faster!</p>

<p>One night stands out&mdash;a gorgeous night&mdash;a
carnival in honour and aid of brave little Serbia.
Kipling says that "East is east and west is west,
and never the twain shall meet"; but he surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
has not seen a Venetian carnival in Cairo, with
its intermingling of the progressive Occident and
the picturesque Orient. One will always remember
that. When the tourists from the West overrun
the land of the Pharaohs, as they do once a
year, a Venetian fête is held at Shepheard's&mdash;the
social event of the season. Sightseers
from England, idle rich from the Continent,
plutocrats from America, tourists from the four
quarters of the world, all meet and make merry
here. This year of grace witnessed a somewhat
different spectacle, it is true. It was a polyglot
gathering of all nations, to be sure, but the
tourist element was wanting. In the place of
the tourists, however, was the "Army of Occupation."
Hundreds of officers, British, French,
Egyptian, Australian and New Zealand, in smart
uniforms, gave striking colour to the scene,
which was made additionally picturesque by the
vari-coloured silks and satins, scarfs and veils
of the ladies. The garden was a blaze of splendour.
There were the flags of the nations, there
were flowers and palms and purling fountains,
mirth and music, lights and laughter, and over
all&mdash;confetti. All night the air was thick with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
confetti, like snow falling off a rainbow. Revellers
flew hither and thither, flinging it everywhere.
Merry maidens threw handfuls of confetti and
eyesful of bold glances at the sun-tanned colonials.
There was no respite until the ground was
ankle-deep with confetti.</p>

<p>Tired at last of the revelry, we adjourned to
the Moorish Hall, and while the orchestra played
the ravishing strains of the barcarolle we danced
the red stars to their death.</p>

<p>Loud explosions in the courtyard sent us
rushing forth once more. And then we saw the
most wonderful pyrotechnic display in all the
world. Without warning, odd corners of the
garden burst into a blaze of light. Rockets,
Roman candles, Catherine wheels, shooting stars
and all the fireworks we loved as youngsters were
there in full working order, but ever so many
more and ever so much grander than at those
"Queen's Birthday" exhibitions which ourselves
when young did eagerly frequent. Shall we
ever forget that final burst of coloured lights
outlining the words "Hurrah for Serbia!"
Not <em>I</em>. No more than I shall ever forget the
deeds of glory of the Serbians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>And I remember another fête&mdash;the "Grande
Fête du 75," held in the Cairo International
Sporting Club's grounds, in honour of the 75
millimetre field gun of the French, and in aid of
the sick and wounded soldiers of the "Army
of the East," then at the Dardanelles. There
was a great crowd present. In the viceregal
stand was a distinguished gathering of generals,
consuls, ministers and diplomats. Scores of
beautiful French girls, escorted by British officers&mdash;by
way of emphasizing the Entente Cordiale,
no doubt&mdash;meandered amongst the crowd selling
commemorative medals. There were military
sports by day, and there was a torchlight procession
round the arena and through the streets of
Cairo by night.</p>

<p>Then we went back to our camp in the desert
to wait for the word to "move on." But I will
never forget those Egyptian nights ... and one
girl of girls. Tall and stately, like a queen she
moved amongst the revellers. The rest of the
dancers were just the frame round her picture....
We danced. Her blue eyes laughed into
mine.... And the world has never been the
same world since.</p>

<p class="mt2">Some of the Australians and New Zealanders
had already got the call, but we of the Light
Horse still waited&mdash;growing more and more
impatient every day. I have vivid recollections
of a captain swearing. I have still more vivid
recollections of a certain private's reminiscences.
It was generally thought that he had spent some
time in hell, or Booligal, so familiarly did he
speak of the infernal regions. I remember his
saying&mdash;but no, I will not repeat it.</p>

<p>Chiefly do I remember the riot. It seemed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
something must be done to stir the authorities
up; and some of the "hot heads" got up a riot
in Cairo. They went into Cairo singing "There'll
be a hot time in the old town to-night"; and
sure enough there was. It was not meant to be
quite so hot as it turned out. Things have a
way of shaping themselves sometimes. Nobody
could tell afterwards exactly how it all happened;
but before the night was spent some houses had
been burned down, some shots had been fired and
some men had been wounded. There were some
Australians, some New Zealanders, some Maoris
and a few Territorials in it. And it all happened
so simply. Some publicans and other sinners
presumed to treat the Maoris as "niggers."
This was too much for the New Zealanders,
and they began to pull some of the furniture out
of a public-house, and to make a bonfire of it in
the street, the while the Maoris danced a war
dance round it.</p>

<p>One or two other bonfires were started. The
native police rolled up and kept the crowd back,
one of the police inspectors remarking that it
would be a good thing for Cairo if a few more
of the "dens" were burned down. "I've been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
wishing for a fire among these rotten tenements
for a long time," he said, "and now the fire-engines
are coming, and it looks as if they'll be
saved again!"</p>

<p>The fire-engine came clattering up the street.
The soldiers raided it. In self-defence the firemen
repelled the attack with the fire-hose. The
soldiers renewed the attack and, reinforcements
having arrived, captured the hose and turned it
on the firemen, completely routing them. Then
they cut the hose up&mdash;and the Maoris went on
with their "haka."</p>

<p>But in the end, of course, law and order had
to prevail. Other engines came upon the scene,
escorted by a squadron of Territorial Dragoons.
The soldiers cooled down. The fires were put
out. There's a lot more about this battle of the
Wazir, but I cannot tell it.</p>

<p>Not creditable, of course. Not quite the sort
of thing they had been sent there for. But
human nature is human nature, and a crowd of
soldiers is a crowd of soldiers, and bad grog
will make the best of soldiers bad, especially in
Cairo; and the evil that's in men must come
out of them as well as the good. Hence to call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the Maoris "niggers"&mdash;well, who can blame the
New Zealanders for resenting it, and who can
blame the Australians for siding with the New
Zealanders, or the Territorials for assisting their
Oversea brethren, when we have Mr. Asquith's
own word for it that "Who touches them touches
us"? Not creditable!&mdash;but human nature&mdash;British
brotherhood! And high spirits, and the
chafing under the monotony of camp life in
Egypt! Trooper Bluegum, at all events, long
ago forgave them. The same men were among
those who were to create for themselves and their
country, in the words of General Ian Hamilton,
"An imperishable record of military virtue."
Many of them are no more. Maoris and all have
given their lives cheerfully for their Empire
and the sacred cause of Right. Let us remember
their virtues and forget their faults.</p>

<p>There came a day when there was sudden movement
in the camp. General Birdwood had arrived&mdash;one
of Kitchener's "hard riding" generals,
with a wonderful string of medals and decorations&mdash;and
there were other "signs of the zodiac"
pointing to our early departure. When at last,
at the "Stadium," Colonel Ryrie announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
to us of the 2nd Light Horse that we were to
make ready, you could have heard the cheering
miles away. The residents of Ma'adi, when they
heard it, thought peace had been declared!</p>

<p>It was the arrival of our Australian wounded
back from the Dardanelles that settled it. It
was a wrench to leave our horses behind&mdash;the
dear old horses that we petted and loved, the
horses that were a very part of us&mdash;but it had to
be done. When we saw our fellows coming back
with their wounds upon them&mdash;when we heard of
what they had been through&mdash;when we listened to
their story of that wonderful landing on Gallipoli
on April 25, and of the wild charge they made
up the frowning hill&mdash;all of us, to a man, begged
to be sent to the front as infantry! We were
Light Horsemen, and we hadn't been trained as
infantry, but it didn't matter&mdash;we were soldiers
of the King!</p>

<p>I saw the Red Crescent train as it steamed in
loaded with the wounded, and I went to the
base hospital to see and chat with the men who
knew now what war was&mdash;the men who had
clamoured so impatiently for so many weeks to
be sent where "the fighting" was, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
came back again to be nursed in an Egyptian
hospital! Yet they were happy. They had
"done their bit." They smoked cigarettes and
yarned about their experiences. I watched the
slightly wounded ones marching from the train
to the hospital&mdash;an unforgettable sight. Most
of them were shot about the arms or scalp.
Their uniforms had dried blood all over them, and
were torn about where the field doctors had
ripped off sleeves or other parts to get at the
wounds. As they marched irregularly along,
one young fellow with his arm in a sling and a
flesh wound in the leg limped behind and shouted
out: "Hey, you chaps, don't make it a welter!"</p>

<p>Our men were just splendid in the fight. An
Imperial officer who has been all over France and
Flanders said that Colonel Maclagan's Australian
Brigade was the finest brigade of infantry in
the whole of the Allied armies. That was praise
indeed. And I remember another fine tribute
that was paid to them. "No troops in the whole
world could possibly have done better than those
magnificent Australian infantry. They performed
the impossible. In the face of exploding mines
and withering fire from machine guns, shrapnel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and rifles, they stormed the hills and, with bloody
bayonets, routed the Turks and Germans."
That was a tribute the more valuable because it
was not an Australian who spoke, neither was it
an Englishman, but a Frenchman. It was the
remark of a French naval officer who watched
the landing of the Australian Division on Gallipoli.
And when the whole tale was told the world saw
how rightly our boys deserved all that was said
of them.</p>

<p>What a terribly expensive business it was all
to be! How many brave Australians and New
Zealanders&mdash;yes, and Englishmen, Frenchmen
and Indians&mdash;were yet to be sacrificed! It is
well that the Great Ruler over all, Who holds us
in the hollow of His hands, does not permit poor
mortals to see into the future. The "forcing
of the Dardanelles"&mdash;the words were on the lips
of all of us and were printed in newspapers all
over the world&mdash;it seemed only a matter of a little
while, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Great is the British Navy, magnificent are
its officers and men, but hellish was the work
of "forcing the Dardanelles." You remember
how the <i>Goliath</i> and the <i>Irresistible</i> went down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
You remember how a great French ship&mdash;the
<i>Bouvet</i>&mdash;was sunk. You remember the mines
that came down the waters, and the shore torpedoes,
and the strength of the Turkish forts,
the power of the Turkish guns, erected and
manned by German officers. The Navy could
not force the Dardanelles alone! It was necessary
to have the co-operation of land forces.
Perhaps the operations should never have been
begun until the Army was ready to co-operate.
I do not know; it is not for me to judge.</p>

<p>General Sir Ian Hamilton first visited the
Dardanelles and carried out a reconnaissance
on one of the warships and then came to Egypt&mdash;a
lightning visit&mdash;and our forces began to move.
Australia, for the first time, was right up against
the Hun! South Africa was a picnic to it.</p>

<p>There were spies everywhere. There were
spies in the transports, spies amongst the interpreters,
spies in the supply depots. The Turks,
or rather their German officers, were kept informed
of every move the Allies made. They
knew exactly the hour of disembarkation and
the places of landing. They learned all the
Australian bugle calls and used them with telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
effect. The French landed and formed up as
if on parade, and then, with beautiful precision,
marched on and drove the enemy before them.
The British, despite the fusillade which greeted
them on landing, were steady as veterans and
there was no hope of withstanding their landing.</p>

<p>But there was an electric quality about the
charge of the Australians that inspired panic
in the Turkish trenches. Fiercely angry at the
loss of several of their officers, they charged with
fixed bayonets, not waiting for supports.</p>

<p>One charge was led by a doctor; another by
a priest. Several times they charged so fiercely
that they looked like getting out of hand. Scorning
cover, they also scorned rifle fire. They
scaled the steel-lined heights like demons. It was
the bayonet all the time. One huge farmer
actually bayoneted a Turk through the chest
and pitchforked him over his shoulder. The
man who performed this feat was a huge Queenslander&mdash;Sergeant
Burne, of the 9th Battalion,
who was afterwards wounded and returned to
his Australian home&mdash;a man whose modesty is
as great as his size. We smiled at first when we
heard the story, and people in England and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Australia read of it with amazement. But
Sergeant Burne, standing over six feet high, and
massively proportioned, looks quite capable of
the feat. He himself tells the story in these
words: "It is not a case for me to take any
credit at all," he said. "I was in the platoon
that landed first on the right. Our lieutenant
was the first man to get ashore&mdash;and as game a
man as ever faced fire. I followed him. I was
ordered to take in hand a line of Turkish sharpshooters
who were causing a lot of trouble.
There was also a machine-gun on the hill. Somebody
had to stop it. Myself and two lads went
up, and we stopped it. That's all. There were
ten Turks there. We got the Turks and we got
the machine-gun, but I lost my two lads. They
were only boys, but let me tell you the Australians
are the best fighters in the world. One of the
lads 'fixed' the German officer who was working
the machine-gun. The Turks were higher up
than we were, and I suppose that is how I was
able to throw one of them over my shoulder.
It's an old trick that is taught in the Guards."</p>

<p>Sergeant Burne once served in the Irish Guards,
and he carries a scar on his forehead, the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of a blow from the butt-end of a rifle at Rhenosterkop,
during the South African war. He had
been living in Australia for about six years when
the Great War broke out, and he was one of the
first to answer the Empire's call. His stay on
Gallipoli was short, for on the same day as that
on which he performed the feat of which I have
written he received a bullet in the shoulder.</p>

<p>"It was a very short experience," he said,
"but I'll be back there again."</p>

<p>And that was, and is, the spirit of them all.</p>

<p>It is sad to think that so many senior officers
lost their lives right at the outset of the fighting
in the Dardanelles. Australia could ill afford
to lose men like Colonel Onslow Thompson,
Colonel MacLaurin, Major F. D. Irvine and Colonel
Braund. Colonel MacLaurin was in the act of
warning soldiers to be certain to keep behind
cover when he was shot in the head. He was
hurriedly conveyed to the rear, but only lingered
half an hour. Curiously enough, he had a
presentiment that he would be killed, and mentioned
it to one of our Light Horse officers just
before leaving for the Dardanelles.</p>

<p class="mt2">It was a wicked trick that resulted in the
slaughter of so many gallant men of the 1st
(N.S.W.) Battalion. They had been holding the
line splendidly, despite shrapnel and maxim
fire and rifles, and had repulsed several attacks
by the enemy. Then a message was passed
down the line for the battalion to attack and
capture the guns in front. Not doubting the
genuineness of the order, the battalion charged,
only to be met with a withering fire, which
immediately told them that a trap had been set.</p>

<p>Their leader, Colonel Onslow Thompson, was
killed instantaneously by a cannon shot which
struck him in the head. He was one of the
first to volunteer in Sydney when war broke out.
Colonel Arnott knew that Colonel Onslow Thompson
was a splendid Light Horse officer, and begged
of him to wait for a mounted regiment. "No,"
he replied, "I'm going, and I'll take the first
chance that offers."</p>

<p>The casualties among the officers were tremendous&mdash;brave
men who led Australia's soldiers
in that awful charge! And among the bravest
of them were the young officers from the Duntroon
Military College that stands amid delightful
country surroundings near the capital of Federated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Australia that is now in the making in the Mother
State of New South Wales. These young fellows
fought in a way that showed their native courage
and the excellence of their training. Only the
year before, when Sir Ian Hamilton, as Inspector-General
of the Oversea Forces, visited Australia
and inspected these lads who were training for
the army at Duntroon, as the representative
of the <cite>Sydney Morning Herald</cite> I remember seeing
them laugh and cheer when Sir Ian Hamilton,
on leaving Duntroon, jokingly wished them
"plenty of wars and rapid promotion." And
it seems only a few days since we were dancing
and flirting in a Cairo ballroom. Now many of
them lie sorely wounded at the base hospital,
and several will never again hear the réveillé. But
the College will not forget its firstfruits offered
up so gladly for empire. Officers and men,
it was all the same&mdash;they went to their death
with a cheer for King and Country. I heard an
Imperial officer, newly returned from Flanders,
say that the 3rd Australian Infantry Brigade
was the finest brigade of infantry in the whole
of the allied armies. In physique they were far
superior to any of the British, French, or Belgian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
troops. Whether this be true or not, there is
no doubt that the sturdy Thirds under Colonel
Maclagan fought like Trojans on the Gallipoli
Peninsula, and covered themselves with glory.
Incidentally, I might mention, some of them
never fired a shot during the fierce fighting of
April 25. They simply trusted to the cold steel,
and flung themselves at the Turkish trenches.
The 1st Brigade (Colonel MacLaurin), the 2nd
(Colonel McCay), and the rest of the Australians
and New Zealanders fought with equal valour,
but the brunt of the attack was borne by the
Thirds. So many hundred gallant lives was a
heavy price to pay for a footing in Gallipoli,
but those impetuous charges, absolutely irresistible
in their fury, would, we knew, bear rich
fruit, for the Turks could never again withstand
a bayonet charge by the Australians.</p>

<p>It was noteworthy that only a few thousand
prisoners were taken. I asked one of the 1st
Battalion boys (Lieutenant-Colonel Dobbin's
command) why that was. He replied: "How
could 12,000 of us take prisoners when we were
up against 35,000?"</p>

<p>And through it all our Army Medical Corps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
did yeoman service. Several stretcher-bearers
were shot, for they dashed forward too soon to
succour the wounded. The doctors were right
up in the firing-line all the while. Colonel Ryan
and some other doctors were attending to serious
cases on the beach, where the landing was effected,
and snipers shot two orderlies who were assisting,
one on each side of the colonel.</p>

<p>I doubt if there was a single branch of the
service that did not suffer and share in the glory
of that charge.</p>

<p>General Bridges handled his gallant Australians
with consummate skill. He seemed to anticipate
the Turkish attacks. His dispositions for defence
were brilliant. Then General Godley and his
New Zealanders landed and threw themselves
into the fray. General Birdwood came and took
charge of the Australian, New Zealand Army
Corps ... A.N.Z.A.C.! From that fateful day,
April 25, Anzac has been a name to conjure with.</p>

<p class="mt2">"Bah!" he exclaimed as he lit his cigarette.
"The Turks can't shoot for nuts!
But the German machine-guns are the devil,
and the shrapnel is no picnic!"</p>

<p>His arm was in a sling, and his leg was bandaged
from hip to ankle. But he was cheerful
as could be, as proud as Punch, and as chirpy
as a gamecock. For he was one of the band of
Australian heroes, wounded and back from the
front. And we who listened to the deathless
story of the wild charge they made could not help
wishing we had shared in the glories of that fight.</p>

<p>"It's the Germans we're up against," he went
on. "You see they have taught the Turks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
all sorts of nasty tricks. One of the tricks is
to surrender just at the last minute. One Turk
in a trench shot my pal on my right and a chap
on my left; then when we got right into the
trench he suddenly dropped his rifle and put up
his hands. I reckoned that wasn't fair, so I
jammed my bayonet into him. Time and again
the Turks would shoot till we were right on top
of them, and then drop guns and surrender.
Call that fair fighting?"</p>

<p>Another chap with his tunic all clotted with
blood and his head in a bandage here interpolated:
"Say, you needn't fear the Turks'
shooting. It's safer to be in the firing-line than
in the reserves. But look out for those machine-guns;
they spit death at you at the rate of ten
a second. Also, keep your eyes open for the
snipers. We drove them back for miles behind
Sari Bair, but there were snipers everywhere.
They never minded being killed so long as they
could pick off a few officers. One black devil
shot our captain at only fifty yards. Five of
us got to him, and gave him just what Brutus,
Cassius, Casca and the rest gave Julius Cæsar."</p>

<p>"We fought them for three days after landing,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
said a big bushman in the 2nd Brigade,
"and they made about a dozen counter-attacks.
But when we had a chance of sitting down and
letting them charge us it was dead easy&mdash;just
like money from home. They never got near
enough to sample the bayonets again. But on
the 27th they tried to get all over us. They let
the artillery work overtime, and we suffered a
bit from the shrapnel. The noise was deafening.
Suddenly it ceased, and a new Turkish division
was launched at us. This was just before breakfast.
There is no doubt about the bravery of
the Turks. But we were comfortably entrenched,
and it was their turn to advance in the open.
We pumped lead into them till our rifles were
too hot to hold. Time and again they came on,
and each time we sent them about their business.
At three o'clock we got tired of slaughtering them
that way, so we left our little home in the trench
and went after them again with the bayonet."</p>

<p>"Say, what do you think of 'Big Lizzie'?"
asked another blood-bespattered Cornstalk.
"Ain't she the dizzy limit?"</p>

<p>Is it necessary to explain that this was the
affectionate way our fellows alluded to the super-Dreadnought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
<i>Queen Elizabeth</i>? The soldier
continued: "All the while our transports were
landing, 'Big Lizzie' just glided up and down
like an old hen watching her chickens. Every
now and then the Turkish destroyers from
Nagara tried to cut in and smash up the transports.
But the moment 'Lizzie' got a move
on they skedaddled. One ship was just a bit
slow. Didn't know that 'Big Liz' could hit
ten miles off. Shell landed fair amidships, and
it was good night, nurse."</p>

<p>One of the 9th Battalion (Queenslanders,
under Colonel Lee) chipped in here: "Ever
tried wading through barbed wire and water with
maxims zipping all round you?"</p>

<p>This pertinent question explained the severe
losses of the 3rd Brigade. The landing was
effected simultaneously at several points on
the peninsula, but one spot was a hornet's nest
and they started to sting when the Australians
reached the beach. A couple of boats were
upset and several sailors and soldiers killed.
Others dashing into the shallow water were
caught in the barbed wire.</p>

<p>"My legs are tattooed prettier than a picture,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
added the Queenslander, "and I've a
bit of shrapnel shell here for a keepsake, somewhere
under my shoulder."</p>

<p>"Fancy ten thousand miles and eight months'
training all for nix," said a disgusted corporal.
"Landed at 4 a.m. Shot at three seconds past four.
Back on the boat at 5 a.m."</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>To have gone through all they had gone
through, and then to treat it all so lightly, seemed
an extraordinary thing. All the doctors and
nurses commented on the amazing fortitude
and cheerfulness of the Australian wounded.
I used to think the desire to be in the thick of
things, that I had so often heard expressed,
was make-believe, but I know better now. I
used to say myself that I "wanted to be there"
(and <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">sotto voce</i> I used to add "I don't think");
and now, in my heart-searchings, I began to
wonder if I didn't really mean it, after all. I
used to strike an attitude and quote, "One
crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age
without a name," whilst all the time I felt in my
heart that I would prefer a crowded age of glorious
life to an hour of fame. Now I began to wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
whether in my heart's core, in my very heart of
hearts, I did not agree with the poet. The
proper study of mankind is Oneself. And
what was I doing there, anyway?</p>

<p>Yes, it was extraordinary&mdash;not a doubt of it.
Doctors and nurses said they never saw anything
like it in the world. Those soldiers back
from the Dardanelles, many of them sorely
wounded, were laughing and joking all day,
chatting cheerfully about their terrible experiences,
and itching to get back again and "do for
the dirty Turks"!</p>

<p>"Nurse," said one of them, with a shattered
leg, as he raised himself with difficulty, "will
you write a little note for me?"</p>

<p>She came over and sat at the side of the bed,
paper and pencil in hand.</p>

<p>"'My dear mother and father, I hope this
letter finds you as well as it leaves me at present.'...
How's that for a beginning, nurse?" he
said with a smile.</p>

<p>I heard of another man who sent a letter from
the Dardanelles. It ran: "Dear Aunt, this
war is a fair cow. Your affectionate nephew."
Just that, and nothing more. The Censor, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
have no doubt, would think it a pity to cut anything
out of it.</p>

<p>I heard of another, and at the risk of an intrusion
into the private affairs of any of our soldiers,
I make bold to give it. It was just this: "My
darling Helen, I would rather be spending the
evening with you than with two dead Turks in
this trench. Still it might be worse, I suppose."</p>

<p>Those cheerful Australians!</p>

<p>Can you wonder that the Light Horse wanted
to get a move on and make a start for the front?
Can you wonder that when we heard of the terrible
list of casualties which were the price of
victory, and when we saw our men coming back, many
of them old friends, with their battle-scars
upon them, we fretted and fumed impatiently?
We had a church parade, and the
chaplain, Captain Keith Miller, preached from
the text, "Let us run with patience the race
that is set before us," and it only made us angry.
There was only one text that appealed to us,
and that was "How long, O Lord, how long?"</p>

<p>We could stand it no longer. Our boys needed
reinforcements, and that was all we cared about.
They must have reinforcements. It would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
some days before men could arrive from England
and France. Sir Ian Hamilton wanted
men to push home the attack and ensure the
victory. We knew that no cavalry could go
for a couple of weeks, and our fellows were just
"spoiling for a fight." They were sick and tired
of the endless waiting, with wild rumours of
moving every second day. Men from all the
troops and squadrons went to their officers and
volunteered to go as infantry, if only they could
go at once. B Squadron, 6th Regiment, volunteered
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i>.</p>

<p>Colonel Ryrie, accurately gauging the temper
of the men, summoned the regimental commanders,
Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, Lieutenant-Colonel
Harris and Lieutenant-Colonel Arnott. What
happened at this little Council of War we don't
know. But we guess. Word was sent on to
the general that the whole brigade would leave
for the front within an hour, on foot if necessary.</p>

<p>A similar offer had just been made by the 1st
Light Horse Brigade (Colonel Chauvel) and the
1st Brigade of New Zealand Mounted Rifles.</p>

<p>What it cost these gallant horsemen to volunteer
and leave their horses behind only horsemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
can guess. Colonel Ryrie's brigade was said
to be the best-horsed brigade in Egypt. Scores
of men had brought their own horses. After
eight months of soldiering we were deeply
attached to our chargers. Fighting on foot
was not our forte. We were far more at home
in the saddle. But Colonel Ryrie expressed
the dominant thought of the men when he said:
"My brigade are mostly bushmen, and they
never expected to go gravel-crushing, but if
necessary the whole brigade will start to-morrow
on foot, even if we have to tramp the whole way
from Constantinople to Berlin."</p>

<p>There was cheering all along the line when the
news filtered through. Men who had of late
been swearing at the heat and dust and the flies
and the desert suddenly became jovial again.
At dinner they passed the joke along, sang songs,
and cheered everybody, from Kitchener to Andy
Fisher, and the brigadier down to the cooks and
the trumpeters.</p>

<p>So we are off at last, after weary months of
waiting&mdash;on foot. Blistered heels and trenches
ahead; but it's better than sticking here in the
desert doing nothing.</p>

<p>And now, a hundred years after, we see French
and British warships again off Alexandria.
But this time the Union Jack and the Tricolour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>

French and British soldiers and sailors walk

blue jackets and red trousers, French infantry
in their blue-grey uniform, cavalry with gay
tunics, British Jack Tars in blue and white,
Australians in sombre khaki, swarthy-skinned
Maoris from the Wonderland of the Southern

British troops&mdash;and especially those young giants

There were wild cheers at Mena when the news
buzzed round; lusty cheering at Zeitoun when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the New Zealanders heard it; more wild cheering
at Heliopolis and Abassia as the message
flashed further afield. Out at Mena camp there
was great excitement as battalion after battalion
marched away, encouraged by the cheers of
their comrades behind. Trams brimming over
with jubilant human freight moved off from
Mena House, and glided along the well-known
road to Cairo, where trains were waiting to convey
the men to Alexandria. At Alexandria
the transports were waiting to take us to the
Dardanelles. Turkey, forgetting the traditional
friendship of Great Britain, had allowed Germany
to bluff her into invading Egypt. Now, in
return, Britain was knocking at the front door&mdash;the
impregnable front door of Constantinople.</p>

<p>We had a final concert in the cinema tent,
and it was a huge success. The good folk of
Ma'adi rolled up in full force. Charles Knowles,
the famous baritone, came out and sang "The
Trumpeter" and "My old Shako" and "The Old
Brigade" and "Land of Hope and Glory,"
and we all joined in the choruses. The brigadier
made a farewell speech, and thanked the residents
for all their kindness to the men of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
2nd Brigade. He said we were sorry to part with
such good friends, but were glad at last to have
a chance of striking a blow for freedom and
justice and the grand old flag of the Empire.
Of course, we cheered all the time, and we laughed
when genial Mr. Hopkins, President of the Citizen's
Committee, farewelled us with the words,
"God bless you" and "God help the Turks if
you get at them with the bayonet."</p>

<p>We marched away at last. British folk at
Ma'adi and Cairo were enthusiastic, and gave
us a great farewell. Some of the "gyppies"
and Arabs along the roadway were sullenly passive
and apathetic. At the main station, Cairo,
crowds of soldiers assembled to cheer the horseless
horsemen. "We went to South Africa as
infantry, and they mounted us," said a philosophic
Riverina grazier. "Now, we come to
North Africa as Light Horsemen, and they bundle
us off as infantry."</p>

<p>We profited by the experience of the infantry.
Our officers dressed exactly like the men. They
carried rifles and wore bandoliers. All their
pretty uniforms that they "swanked" in at
the continental dances and dinners went by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
board, and they roughed it in service jackets
and hobnailed boots.</p>

<p>Seen from aloft, the 2nd Light Horse embarking
resembled nothing so much as a swarm of
khaki ants covering the quays at Alexandria.
They scurried hither and thither, and to the
onlooker it seemed all confusion worse confounded
by the arrival of additional trains from
Cairo.</p>

<p>But the confusion was more apparent than
real. One noticed soon that all the soldiers
going to the transports were loaded with arms
and ammunition and stores. Those coming
from the ships were empty-handed. And soon
the trains rattled off, the wharves were cleared
and all the troops were aboard. But there
were no fond farewells this time. All the folk
who were near and dear to us were far, far away.
A coffee stall on the quay "manned" by the
Y.W.C.A. worked overtime from four o'clock in
the morning, and our fellows were very grateful
to the ladies of Alexandria who did us this
kindness. They wished us "Good luck," and
we glided out. There were no cheers or sirens
to hearten us. That was all past. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
starting off in grim earnest this time. A few
embarkation officers and transport officials on
the wharf called out "Good luck, boys"; and
that was all.</p>

<p>Half an hour later we were out on the Mediterranean&mdash;the
blue Mediterranean&mdash;and we thought
of all the fleets that in the centuries gone by had
sailed these waters&mdash;Greeks, Romans, Carthaginians,
Spaniards, Turks, French and British.
Our ship was numbered A25&mdash;the <i>Lutzow</i>, one
of the many German liners that had fallen to the
mighty British Navy. And on board were
crowded 2,000 men. No horses! Our gallant
steeds had all been left behind at Ma'adi, ready
to follow the moment we drove the Turks from
the hills and reached "cavalry country." Our
boys had had the chance of coming without
horses or stopping behind; they never hesitated
for a moment.</p>

<p>"Submarine," whispered some one the first
day out. And all eyes searched the waters
round us. But no submarine had been seen.
We had simply been warned that there was a
Turkish submarine somewhere outside the Dardanelles.
So the brigadier, Colonel Ryrie, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
steps to give it a warm reception in case it poked
its nose&mdash;its periscope&mdash;above the surface of the
sea.</p>

<p>The whole brigade was remarkably happy.
Despite the fact that within a couple of days
these men would be fighting for their lives,
despite the fact that their comrades of the
Australian Infantry had just suffered 4,000
casualties in four days, they went as cheerily
forward as their relations in Sydney went to the
Easter Show. And that reminds me that right
here near the Dardanelles I came across a copy
of the Easter number of the <cite>Sydney Mail</cite>. What
a joy it was to escape the war pictures for a brief
while and see, instead, the photographs of prize
pumpkins, of milking shorthorns, and the great
stock parade, and the high jump, and all the other
attractions of one of the greatest shows on earth!
It was just like a message of good cheer from
sunny New South Wales.</p>

<p>We had left Alexandria under sealed orders.
We had to meet a certain warship in a certain
place and get certain instructions. We travelled
at night with all lights out, and threaded our
way with care through the Archipelago. Passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Rhodes and Crete and Tenedos, we reached
the scene of what has been described as the most
picturesque phase of the Great World War&mdash;the
attack on the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>There had been many changes in the brigade,
since the men first went into camp at Rosebery
Park, Sydney, nine months before. Nearly
a thousand men passed through Colonel Cox's
regiment before it finally started out to smash the
Turk and thrash the Hun. There had been
changes also amongst the officers, and as the
exact list has never been published and many
of these officers were soon to lay down their
lives in the service of their country, let me give
their names here&mdash;a permanent record which
will be cherished by those officers and men who
remain and by the families of all the brave dead.</p>

<p class="mt2">The exact strength of the brigade as it entered
Turkish waters was 76 officers and 1,455 other
ranks. Back at Ma'adi we had left about twenty-five
per cent of our men and all our horses. Major
Righetti, of the 5th Light Horse Regiment, had
been appointed Camp Commandant, and we were
hoping that in a couple of weeks at the latest he
and his merry men would join us and then, once
more mounted, we would canter gaily along the
Gallipoli road to Constantinople. We were mostly
young and optimistic! We were soon to find
what a long, long road it was.</p>

<p>It seemed as if they had made special arrangements
for a fine big bombardment just to let the
Light Horse see how it was done. As the 2nd
Light Horse Brigade arrived off Gallipoli we were
eyewitnesses of a spectacular bombardment that
thrilled us. It was about seven o'clock on the evening
of May 18 that our transport glided in between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Tenedos and Imbros and anchored off Helles.
Long before we anchored we could hear the rumbling
of heavy artillery, and we knew that the fleet
was busy. Soon we saw the intermittent flashes
of the guns, and then there loomed up out of the
dusk the spectre-like shapes of the allied warships.
A long, impregnable-looking line they made,
stretching from Kum Kale north and west, and
north again, till they were lost to sight in the
murky pall which was fast settling down on the
Ægean Sea.</p>

<p>All night long the firing continued, but we slept
just as soundly as we had done out on the desert
at Ma'adi. By sunrise the troopers were astir,
crowding the rigging and watching with intense
interest the panorama spread before them. As
the sun peeped over the hills we could see the
tents of the field hospital whitening in the
growing light. All around us were warships and
transports and colliers and supply ships of all
descriptions. Here and there were the low grey
hulls of destroyers streaking across the waters.
From our warships came a desultory fire on the
Turkish trenches.</p>

<p>So intent were we as we watched the camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of the Allies that we never noticed that our own
vessel had dragged its anchor and was fast bearing
down on a French transport a few cable-lengths
off. The ships came together with a
crunch that startled us. We thought for the
moment that we had either been torpedoed or
rammed. Then the nose of the Frenchman
crunched along our port side, smashing stanchions
and gangways, twisting sheet iron into fantastic
shapes and breaking horse-boxes into matchwood.
The active troopers all sprang free of the danger&mdash;all
but one, who was so intent on adjusting his
puttees that he never noticed what was happening.
First thing he knew was when an anchor fluke
caught him bending and drove him with the force
of a battering ram headlong amongst the pans
and dixies. His angry "Imshi yaller" was
drowned in the roar of laughter from his comrades.</p>

<p>Just before breakfast an airman went up&mdash;up
with the lark. He flew up the Dardanelles towards
the Narrows, cut across Maidos to the
Australian Division, doubled back, then swung
round over our heads and turned in and landed.
A valuable reconnaissance was made, the report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
was sent to headquarters, and then the airman
strolled into breakfast. This man and his aeroplane
were a target for Turkish shells and German
gunners all the time. Shell after shell burst
around him, but he took not the slightest notice&mdash;he
said afterwards, with a laugh, that they were
quite "beneath his notice." At one time we
counted eight shell-bursts round about the aeroplane.
It seemed to us who watched him that
the aviator must have borne a charmed life.</p>

<p>Every time I see an air pilot I feel like saluting
him. Colonel Ryrie said that morning, when he
saw the spot on which our infantry had landed:
"After that, I'll take off my hat to the Australian
soldier every time." And that's how I feel
about those gallant airmen.</p>

<p>The enemy's gunners were good; there was no
doubt of that, even though they failed to "wing"
the aeroplane. They next turned their attention
and their fire on the British trenches. For a
while the shells flew wide. Some fell into the
sea; others burst high. Then they got the
range, and kept it. To what extent our comrades
suffered, or how well they were dug in, we could
not see. But the warships soon got to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
and silenced the enemy's guns. Then we went in
to breakfast.</p>

<p>Just before we disembarked Colonel Ryrie
addressed the assembled soldiers. He said his
only fear was that they would be too impetuous.
Their comrades who had gone before had made history.
Their courage and dash and their invincible
charge on a well-nigh impregnable position would
be a theme for historians throughout the ages.
Their only fault was&mdash;they were too brave. They
were ordered to take one strongly-fortified line of
trenches and they actually took three. Concluding,
the brigadier said: "If I get back to Australia
and some of you fellows don't, I know I shall be
able to tell your people that you fought and died
like heroes. If you get back and I don't, I hope
you will be able to tell my countrymen that
Colonel Ryrie played the game."</p>

<p class="mt2">We've had our first week in the trenches.
The Turks have killed some of us, and
we have killed some of them. They certainly
fared the worst; and we agree with the chaplains
that it is more blessed to give than to receive.</p>

<p>In some places our trenches are only seven
yards from the Turks; in others they are 700.
All day and night the sniping continues. Hand
grenades and bombs are thrown to and fro. Aeroplanes
circle aloft and drop bombs on the opposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
trenches. When our aeroplane goes up the
boys yell out: "Lay an egg on the Turkeys!"
When the Taube drops bombs we "duck" to
shelter. Most of our spare time we spend in
dodging shrapnel. It's fine fun, but no one can
guess where the splinters will fly to. We've all
had the sorrow of seeing old comrades struck
down at our sides, and yet we carry on cheerfully.</p>

<p>On Empire Day&mdash;five days after we landed&mdash;the
Turks asked for an armistice to bury their
dead. It took eight hours. In front of our
trenches were 3,500 dead. We reckon that in
the attack on our position on May 18-19 the
enemy had at least 10,000 casualties. The Australians
lost about 500. Time and again the
Turks charged in solid phalanx, but withered
away before the deadly fire of our riflemen.
Whenever they did effect a breach they were
speedily ejected by dashing bayonet attacks by
the Australians and New Zealanders.</p>

<p>To-day&mdash;May 28&mdash;we are all in the highest
spirits, for we have received a special "Force
Order" from General Sir Ian Hamilton, and it
shows that we have not been idle. Here is the
order:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"FORCE ORDER NO. 17.<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">General Headquarters</span>,<br />
<br />
"<i>May 25, 1915</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"1. Now that a clear month has passed since
the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force began
its night and day fighting with the enemy, the
General Commanding desires to explain to officers,
non-commissioned officers and men the real
significance of the calls made upon them to risk
their lives, apparently for nothing better than to
gain a few yards of uncultivated land.</p>

<p>"2. A comparatively small body of the finest
troops in the world, French and British, have
effected a lodgment close to the heart of a great
continental empire, still formidable even in its
decadence. Here they stand firm, or slowly
advance, and in the efforts made by successive
Turkish armies to dislodge them the rotten
Government at Constantinople is gradually wearing
itself out. The facts and figures upon which
this conclusion is based have been checked and
verified from a variety of sources. Agents of
neutral powers possessing good sources of information
have placed both the numbers and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
losses of the enemy much higher than they are
set forth here, but the General Commanding prefers
to be on the safe side and to give his troops a
strictly conservative estimate.</p>

<p>"Before operations began the strength of the
defenders of the Dardanelles was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gallipoli Peninsula, 34,000 and about 100
guns.</p>

<p>"Asiatic side of Straits, 41,000.</p>

<p>"All the troops on the Gallipoli Peninsula
and fifty per cent of the troops on the Asiatic
side were Nizam, that is to say, regular first line
troops. They were transferable, and were
actually transferred to the side upon which the
invaders disembarked. Our Expeditionary Force
effected its landing, it will be seen, in the face of
an enemy superior not only to the covering parties
which got ashore the first day, but superior
actually to the total strength at our disposal.
By May 12 the Turkish army of occupation had
been defeated in several engagements, and would
have been at the end of their resources had
they not meanwhile received reinforcements of
20,000 infantry and twenty-one batteries of Field
Artillery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Still the Expeditionary Force held its own,
and more than held its own, inflicting fresh
bloody defeats upon the new-comers; and again
the Turks must certainly have given way had not
a second reinforcement reached the Peninsula
from Constantinople and Smyrna, amounting at
the lowest estimate to 24,000 men.</p>

<p>"3. From what has been said it will be understood
that the Mediterranean Expeditionary
Force, supported by its gallant comrades of the
Fleet, but with constantly diminishing effectives,
has held in check or wrested ground from
some 120,000 Turkish troops elaborately entrenched
and supported by a powerful artillery.</p>

<p>"The enemy has now few more Nizam troops
at his disposal and not many Redif or second-class
troops. Up to date his casualties are 55,000,
and again, in giving this figure, the General
Commanding has preferred to err on the side of
low estimates.</p>

<p>"Daily we make progress, and whenever the
reinforcements close at hand begin to put in an
appearance, the Mediterranean Expeditionary
Force will press forward with a fresh impulse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
accomplish the greatest Imperial task ever
entrusted to an army.</p>

<p>And I have by me a copy of the little one-page
<cite>Peninsula Press</cite> published at Sir Ian Hamilton's
headquarters some distance from Anzac.
It is No. 13, and is dated May 25, 1915; and it
gives this "Official Account" of the enemy's
losses:&mdash;"The burial of the dead on the Australian
and New Zealand front was completed yesterday
under the armistice asked for by the
Turks. The number of the enemy's dead lying
between the trenches was estimated at 3,500,
counting only those who have fallen since May 18.
Rifle fire broke out soon after the close of the
armistice."</p>

<p>That <cite>Peninsula Press</cite>, little thing though it
was, used to be read and re-read till we could
almost repeat all its contents word for word. It
gave us the war news on all fronts in a nutshell.
In this particular number we read of the great
Russian victory in East Galicia, when the Austrians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
were pushed back from the Dniester to
the Pruth, and on a 100-mile battle-front the
Russians took 20,000 prisoners in five days. We
read of von Bethmann-Hollweg's threat to Italy&mdash;his
threat to punish Germany's "faithless
ally" who had seen fit to throw over the Powers
of Darkness for those of Light and Freedom and
Civilization. We read of the German losses
between Steenstraete and Ypres, despite their
use of asphyxiating gas which their enlightened
scientists had been able to place at their disposal.
We read this: "The British Navy has rescued
1,282 German seamen and marines from German
warships sunk. Not one British seaman or
marine has been saved by Germans in like circumstances."
We read an extract from the
Greek newspaper <cite>Athinai</cite> relating to the
elections in that country: "If the people give the
victory to the party of M. Venizelos, then the
Entente Powers will have no further anxiety
concerning us; Greece will be ready for war in
accordance with the programme of M. Venizelos
and with the engagements he has assumed."
(And the people did give the victory to M. Venizelos&mdash;but
Greece, oh, where was she?) And this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
also we read in our paper: "The people of
Gallipoli Town," says a Turkish correspondent,
"have seen only four British (Australian) prisoners
of war. The men excited great admiration
among the people, because it was seen that they
were indeed soldiers. They wandered about
freely and drank coffee, creating great excitement
by their queer remarks and causing no ill-feeling."
And the <i>Lusitania</i>! We read the
lines from <cite>Punch</cite> of May 12&mdash;Britain to
America, on the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In silence you have looked on felon blows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On butcher's work of which the waste lands reek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, in God's name, from Whom your greatness flows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sister, will you not speak?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We ourselves had seen a ship go down. We
saw the <i>Triumph</i> torpedoed. We saw her shiver
from stem to stern&mdash;and then go down in the sea.
She was a triumph of man's handiwork, and
man's handiwork had destroyed her. The sea
was very calm, but submarines and mines lurk
in still waters as well as rough&mdash;and out of the
calm sea came the thing of death. From the
moment she was struck till she turned turtle but
fourteen minutes elapsed. A dozen launches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
and torpedo boats rushed to rescue the crew, and
all were saved except about forty. And we who
saw it all from the trenches looked on at it stupefied.
With a mighty lurch&mdash;as it were a giant
in the agonies of death&mdash;the <i>Triumph</i> heeled over
and was gone.</p>

<p>Such things are done, and will be done, as long
as there are Hymns of Hate in the world. War
is a gruesome business.</p>

<p>Just as I walked out of my dug-out this morning
two men were shot by a machine-gun not ten
yards off&mdash;one in the shoulder and the other in
the eye. Two seconds ago a big shrapnel shell
burst right in front of our dug-out. The bullets
flew everywhere, and we bolted to shelter. No
one was injured. It is marvellous. Up to the
present it has been the most wonderful week in
my life&mdash;full of excitement and hair-breadth
escapes.</p>

<p>Sunday came&mdash;May 30. The day dawned
peacefully, minus the artillery duel which ordinarily
heralds the coming day. The blue Mediterranean
lay like a sea of glass at our feet. Imbros
Island, opposite Anzac Cove, lay wreathed in the
morning mists. Torpedo boats glided to and fro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
across the waters, lest some adventurous submarine
should attack. All was peaceful. Ashore,
the wild flowers blossomed on the hillsides.
Birds chirruped contentedly in the scrub. Soldiers
released from a night's vigil in the trenches
sauntered along the winding road to the beach,
dived in and sported freely in the sea. The
transport mules munched contentedly, and the
Indians lay back smoking hubble-bubbles. Light
Horsemen (minus their horses) and infantrymen
emerged from their dug-outs and stretched themselves
lazily in the sun.</p>

<p>It was too good to last&mdash;too good altogether.
Some activity behind the Turkish trenches attracted
the attention of our artillery observation
officers, and our guns boomed out a warning. It
was evidently disregarded by the enemy, for more
of our guns opened fire. Then the Turks replied.
The hills around spat fire, and the valleys echoed
and re-echoed with peals of thunder. Shrapnel
shells and "Jack Johnsons" went screaming
overhead, to burst with a deafening report over
our trenches and bivouacs. Our guns were so
cunningly concealed that the German artillery
officers could not locate them, and for the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
part their shells ploughed up the unoffending
earth, or made harmless rents in the atmosphere.
Our artillery had better success. Our guns tore
down the Turkish trenches, and the Turks flying
to shelter were met with a devastating fire from
our machine-guns. Still, we did not have it all
our own way. Now and then a shell landed in
our trenches, and the story of it was told in the
casualty lists.</p>

<p>About one o'clock the artillery duel began, and
it continued without cessation for over an hour.
The roar was awful. Bullets spattered everywhere.
The marvel was that our losses were so
few. Gradually the big guns grew silent. Our
warships aimed a few salvos on to the enemy's
position, then drew off. Soon there was comparative
calm. There remained but the interminable
fusillade of musketry which never wholly
ceased on the trenches round Anzac.</p>

<p>At eventide the Ægean Sea took on new colourings.
The sun set in a blaze of splendour; the
whole western horizon was alight with its reflected
brilliance. The islands seemed to rest
against a superb canvas on which Nature had
splashed lavishly a wealth of gold and rose-red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
and saffron and purple and amethyst. The sea
in turn mirrored and accentuated the beauties
of the scene. The angry armies gazed in quiet
contemplation of Nature's craftsmanship, forgetting
their mutual hate.</p>

<p>Up on Braund's Hill&mdash;where Colonel Braund,
who used to sit for Armidale in the New South
Wales Parliament, had met with a tragic fate
soon after the historic landing was made&mdash;right
at the entrance to the trenches in the firing-line,
Divine Service was being held. In the days of
my wanderings I have attended many church
services, in shearing-sheds and on mining fields,
on board troopships, and in the bush; but never
had I attended such a service as this. Captain
McKenzie, of the 1st Infantry Brigade, and Captain
Robertson, of the 2nd Light Horse, were
the officiating chaplains. Soldiers, unkempt, unshaven,
unwashed, lolled around on the path or
the hillside. Men coming from the trenches
joined in the singing. Men going to the trenches
for the night lingered awhile. And they sang
the old well-known hymns. None asked for
"Onward, Christian Soldiers," or any of the
warlike hymns at all. They wanted the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
gospel hymns. So we sang, "Jesus, Lover of My
Soul," "Sweet Hour of Prayer," and "Abide
with Me." ...</p>

<p>Firing had recommenced before we finished
the service, and the chaplain's voice was now
and then drowned in the rattle of musketry or
the bursting of shrapnel. And because of the
shells and bombs which continually burst overhead,
we meant it when we sang "Cover my
defenceless head with the shadow of Thy wing."</p>

<p>A few words of prayer, a few words of exhortation
and commendation, and then the service
was over. Some filed off to the trenches for the
vigil of the night. Others formed up for the
reserves. The rest of us returned to our dug-outs,
to snuggle in while the roar of battle raged overhead.
And one soon gets used to the battle
noises. I fell asleep thinking of dear old New
South Wales, my dear old home, and&mdash;my dear
old mother.</p>

<small>STORIES THAT WILL NEVER DIE</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"CANARIES"&mdash;THE SAVING GRACE&mdash;THE LOST
HORSE BRIGADE&mdash;A FORGOTTEN COUNTER-SIGN&mdash;"LET'S
AT 'EM"&mdash;POLITE TURK AND
SULKY GERMAN&mdash;MURPHY'S MULES&mdash;MURPHY
AT THE GATE</p></div>


<p class="mt2">Life in the trenches became quite bearable&mdash;after
a time. But it took time. At
first when a bullet skimmed the parapet and went
whistling overhead we ducked instinctively. But
the experienced infantry laughed, and said,
"They're only 'canaries'." Again, when the
shrapnel came hurtling aloft and burst with an
ugly roar, we crouched and waited for death;
but the old hands explained that if we could hear
it burst we were pretty safe. It was the shells we
couldn't hear that we ought to dodge. We understood
that epigrammatic utterance better later on.</p>

<p>But one thing is absolutely essential for a philosophic
enjoyment of trench life&mdash;and that is a
sense of humour. Failing that, most of the soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
would in the end go stark, staring mad. It
is this saving grace which makes our Australians
such a wonderful fighting force. They go laughing
into the firing-line. They come laughing out
again. They laugh as they load and fire. Nearly
every wounded man I've seen laughs. A staff
officer said the other day: "It's only when they're
killed that these Australians cease laughing."</p>

<p>Our three Australian Light Horse brigades have
now been in the trenches for some time. "We
came to Egypt as horsemen," said a Hunter
River man; "then we did foot-slogging at Cairo
and Alexandria, and now we're living in caves
and tunnels, like rabbits or troglodytes."</p>

<p>Since the days of Darwin quite a lot has been
written about evolution. But we never thought
of evolution in connexion with our Light Horse
Brigade. We soon found that we couldn't escape
the process any more than the rest of the universe.</p>

<p>One would have thought that as new and awful
weapons of destruction were evolved, battles
would become short, sharp, and decisive. Instead
of that, they are toilsome, long-drawn-out,
and indecisive. I cannot say why. The elucidation
of the problem I leave to the "experts."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
All I am concerned with is the story of how the
2nd Light Horse Brigade became the Lost Horse
Brigade. Australia sent four Light Horse brigades
to uphold the honour of the Commonwealth;
first, Colonel Chauvel; second, Colonel Ryrie;
third, Colonel Hughes; fourth, Colonel Brown. At
first we thought we were going to be armed with
swords as well as rifles. When first mounted,
despite our sombre khaki, we felt as proud as Life
Guardsmen. And we saw visions and dreamed
dreams, and pictured the Australian Light Horse
on the left wing of the Empire army driving the
Huns in confusion over the Rhine and back to
Berlin.</p>

<p>Hope on, hope ever. All we have done so far
is, by process of devolution, to change from prospective
cavalry to mounted infantry, to foot-sloggers,
to pick and shovel artists, and finally
to troglodytes. The pen is mightier than the
sword&mdash;but so is the spade.</p>

<p>We did not like the packs at first. Our horses
used to carry our kits, and it was rather irksome
to be transformed suddenly into beasts of burden.
Also, we imbibed a new respect for the infantry,
who seemed to carry their heavy packs with consummate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
ease. Ours at first felt like the Burden
to Christian. But gradually we, too, developed
the necessary back and shoulder muscles for the
infantryman's job. We trudged up and down
the hills of Anzac; we filed into the trenches and
took our stations at the loopholes; on the day
of the armistice we helped to bury the dead Turks
whom Enver Pasha had ordered to drive the Australians
into the sea. Then it was that the infantry,
seeing "2 L.H.B." on our shoulder straps,
called us the 2nd <em>Lost</em> Horse Brigade.</p>

<p>But we didn't mind losing our horses so long as
we had a finger in the Gallipoli Pie. Trench warfare
suited us well enough. The firing-line was
always interesting. Everybody was light-hearted.
Jokes and laughter passed the time pleasantly
when we were not sniping or observing. It
meant a little more work when the Turkish (or
German) guns smashed in our parapets and half-choked,
half-blinded and half-buried us. Now
and then some of our chaps stopped a bullet or a
bit of shrapnel. But we dealt out more than we
got. Every day the Officer Commanding and the
Brigadier made a tour of the firing-line, while we
often had three generals to see us on special days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
The day after the big attack General Birdwood
asked one of the 1st Light Horse Regiment if he
had killed many Turks, and he answered, "Yes,
miles of the cows."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the Australians were almost
quarrelling for positions in the firing-line that
night. When the fight was at its hottest, men
in the supports were offering bribes of tobacco
and cigarettes to the men in the firing-line to
swap places with them just for ten minutes. Our
night patrols had great fun harassing the enemy;
but for the bulk of us it got monotonous. It was
nothing but dig new saps, new tunnels, new
trenches, day after day and night after night.</p>

<p>The 6th Light Horse Regiment changed
its badge and its motto. When we left Sydney
we had beautiful badges with a fighting cock
and the motto "Fight on, fight ever." We've
got a new badge now&mdash;pick and shovel, argent,
crossed on an azure shield, and our new motto
is "Dig on, dig ever."</p>

<p>The 7th Light Horse Regiment also changed
its motto, which used to be "Patria te
Salutamus." Now the troopers sport a
shield with a picture of a rabbit, and Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Arnott's new motto is "Infra dig. Tunnelabit."</p>

<p>The A.L.H. did their share of the trench fighting
quite as well as their infantry comrades. Day
after day they took their posts as observers or
snipers. Night after night they manned the
loopholes or did patrol work or sapping. When
off duty they bolted to Anzac Cove, and all the
shrapnel shells in the world didn't keep them out
of the water.</p>

<p>The truth is, a lot of our soldiers grew to be
rank fatalists. "If I'm to be killed, I'll be
killed," they said. On the night of the big
attack the men in the supports were begging the
men in the first line to give them a chance:
"Come on down, and let's at 'em; I'm a better
shot than you." With men clamouring for positions
in the firing-line, no wonder the Turks had
10,000 casualties. When it came to the armistice
to bury their dead, a soldier exclaimed, "I don't
mind killing, but I bar burying the cows!"</p>

<p>The Turks made the same mistake about the
Australians that the Yorkshiremen made about
the Australian cricketers. They thought we
were all black. (The Germans knew better, but
encouraged the false idea.) In a Gallipoli paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
we were referred to as Australian blacks, with
the comment that this was "the first time cannibals
had landed on Gallipoli." But after the
wild bayonet charges our men made at Anzac
they called the Australians "the White Gurkhas."
Later on when our first few prisoners were taken
to Gallipoli, the Turks admired their physique,
and exclaimed: "These are indeed soldiers."</p>

<p>"Our army swore terribly in Flanders," it is
written. I'm afraid that our historian will say
the same of the army in Gallipoli. But this is
about their only vice, and they have all the soldierly
virtues that a general could desire. When
the Turks made their big attack, and advanced
yelling "Allah, Allah!" "Mohammed!"
"Allah!" one of our devil-may-care infantrymen
yelled as he fired: "Yes; you can bring them
along too!"</p>

<p>Then there was the Turk who bowed. It was
when the burial parties met between the trenches
to bury the dead. The Turkish officers were
polite and the Germans surly. A Turk picked
up a bomb and started to run back to his trenches.
A Turkish officer ran after him, kicked him, and
returned the bomb with a bow to one of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
officers, thus observing chivalrously the letter
and spirit of the armistice. A Turkish soldier
came up to one of our men and volunteered the
information: "English good&mdash;German no good."
It wasn't much, but it told a lot.</p>

<p>A number of prisoners were taken, and several
more surrendered. But the Turks were between
the devil and the deep sea. If they came with
their rifles towards our trenches we shot them. If
they came without them, their own soldiers shot
them. So they had to sneak in as best they
could, and risk being shot front and rear.</p>

<p>One of the finest things done in those first fatal
days at Anzac must be put to the credit of Murphy's
mules. Murphy's ambulance was looked
for as anxiously as Gunga Din. It was "Murphy!
Murphy! Murphy! an' we'll thank you
for your mules!" As a matter of fact "Murphy"
was a Scotsman, though he hailed from South
Shields, County Durham. His real name was,
I believe, John Simpson Kirkpatrick; some
say it was Latimer, and others that it was
Simpson; and he was a stretcher-bearer. He
used to hurry up with water to the firing-line, and
carry back the wounded. It was a terribly heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
pull up and down Shrapnel Gully, from the
cove to the top of Braund's Hill, so Murphy
"pinched" a couple of mules, and did yeoman
service. He used to leave the mules just under
the brow of the hill and dash forward himself to
the firing-line to save the wounded. "Murphy's"
voice near them sounded like a voice from heaven.
Time after time he climbed the hill and did his
noble work. Day after day he smiled and carried
on. The mules were missed, and they found
out who stole them. But they also found out
what splendid work "Murphy" was doing; so
the officers connived at the theft. They became
accessories after the fact.</p>

"Murphy" on the left, his mate on the right, and little "Shrapnel" in the background.</span>
  </div>

<p>There came a day when "Murphy's mules"
came not. Stretcher-bearers were working overtime,
and the wounded cried "For God's sake,
send 'Murphy's mules'!" Later on they found
the mules grazing contentedly in Shrapnel Valley.
Then they found poor "Murphy".... He had
done his last journey to the top of the hill.</p>

<p>"Where's Murphy?" demanded one of the
1st Battalion.</p>

<p>"Murphy's at heaven's gate," answered the
sergeant, "helping the soldiers through."</p>

<small>TO DRIVE BACK THE TURK</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>THE TWELFTH OF JULY&mdash;AN AFFAIR OF CONSEQUENCE&mdash;A
TURKISH DRIVE&mdash;ACCURATE
ENEMY FIRE&mdash;"COME AND SURRENDER"&mdash;RAPID
ENEMY MOVEMENT&mdash;OUR PURPOSE
ACHIEVED&mdash;A WONDERFUL PROCLAMATION,
MADE IN GERMANY</p></div>


<p class="mt2">We had scores of little affairs of outposts,
and our patrols enjoyed some fine
skirmishes and night encounters. None of them,
however, quite deserved mention in the official
chronicle. But the affair of <i>July 12</i>&mdash;of "glorious
and immortal memory"&mdash;was more important.</p>

<p>It began and coincided with an advance down
south at Helles. The plan of operations there
was to seize the right and right-centre sections
of the foremost system of Turkish trenches, from
the spot where the Kereves Dere meets the sea
to the main Seddel-Bahr&mdash;Krithia Road, a front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
of about 2,500 yards. The object was to complete
the driving back of the Turks to their second
system.</p>

<p>It was a double-barrelled attack, and was
opened after the shore batteries and the ships'
guns had completed the preliminary bombardment.
The first phase was an assault by the
French and our 155th Brigade, who captured the
enemy's trenches after a splendid charge. But
they had to fight like grim death to withstand
the fierce counter-attacks which were made from
the maze of Turkish trenches in the vicinity.
This done, the second phase was entered upon
by the 157th Brigade. They, too, after fierce
fighting, gained their objective, with the help of
the Royal Naval Division. Meanwhile the French
pushed their extreme right on to the mouth of
the Kereves Dere, where it runs into the sea. The
whole position was maintained, despite the persistent
counter-attacks of the Turk.</p>

<p>So much for the southern&mdash;and main&mdash;operation.
Our rôle up north at Anzac was so to
harass the enemy that he would expect a big
attack, and so be unable to reinforce his comrades
down south. The Australian and New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Zealand Army Corps early in the morning engaged
the enemy, and after our artillery had
opened the ball, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade
advanced from the new position it had taken up
at Ryrie's Post towards the Turkish trenches.
The 6th Light Horse (Colonel Cox) and the 7th
Light Horse (Colonel Arnott) sent a squadron
over their trenches. The troopers jumped on to
the parapet with a cheer, and swarmed down the
hill to the comparative safety of the valley below.
By a stroke of luck not one man was hit in this
charge, though they encountered a hail of bullets.
The Turks were too surprised to shoot straight.
Later on the enemy's shrapnel did much execution,
but the only casualty in this initial man&oelig;uvre
was when a trooper of the Sixth tripped
over some of our own barbed wire and rolled, kicking
and swearing, down the hill, to the huge delight
of his comrades.</p>

<p>Pushing out over Holly Spur, towards Pine
Ridge, the Light Horse advance, under Lieutenant
Ferguson, drove the enemy's patrols back and
opened a hot fire on their trenches. Meanwhile,
to stimulate a general attack, the parties were
sent forward in full view of the enemy, and withdrawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
under cover to their original position.
Long lines of bayonets were seen passing along
our trenches and disappearing at the communication
tunnels, thus lending additional colour to
the idea of a general attack. Further demonstrations
by the 5th Light Horse (Lieutenant-Colonel
Harris) on the right wing provoked a wild fusillade
from the enemy, who promptly reinforced his
position all along the line, and the fusillade
became general.</p>

<p>Most noticeable was the rapidity with which
the Turkish&mdash;or German&mdash;artillery came into
action. Within three minutes of the commencement
of operations the Turkish shells were falling
thick and fast on Holly Ridge. They had the
range to a nicety, and it was a miracle how any
of our advance parties escaped annihilation. As
it was, we had five killed and fourteen wounded.
It is estimated that the Turks fired two hundred
rounds of shrapnel on the Light Horse position
in one hundred minutes. Our artillery was by
no means idle. Colonel Rosenthal concentrated
a devastating fire on to the enemy's trenches and
gun emplacements. Our howitzers landed high
explosives amongst the enemy's reserves, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the enemy's guns battered our trenches. The
roar of the cannonade was terrific.</p>

<p>We did not know exactly how fared the infantry
on our left, or the New Zealanders further
north. But we did know, by the rapid reinforcement
of the enemy's position, that our demonstration
had achieved its purpose.</p>

<p>One would like to mention all the acts of gallantry
which were done on this occasion. But no
one saw them all. I was so busy dodging shrapnel
shells that I saw only a few. Anyhow, our
chaps did not come with a view to getting medals.
Other gallant soldiers of the Seventh and Sixth
and Fifth will never get mentioned in dispatches.</p>

<p>After eight weeks on the inhospitable shores of
Gallipoli, the Turks at last took pity on the Australians.
They promised us excellent treatment
and ample provisions. All we had to do was to
"Come and surrender."</p>

<p>This cheery invitation was scattered broadcast
over the Gallipoli Peninsula by a German
aeroplane. But the pilot was such a poor shot
that not one of the messages fell in the league-long
trenches of the Australians and New Zealanders.
The wind wafted them all across into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the Turkish lines. But our friends next door
(they are only ten feet away in one place) wrote
nasty messages on the papers and threw them
back into our lines.</p>

<p>It was a most interesting document, the one
we received. It informed us that the British
Navy had abandoned us to our fate. Unfortunately
for the Turks, half a dozen warships
and a flotilla of submarines were at that moment
thundering away at the Turkish batteries.
Another bit of news to the Australians was that
"Greedy England made us fight under a contract."
Anyway, as we had not completed the
contract we did not like the idea of quitting the
job.</p>

<p>However, here is the grandiloquent German-made
proclamation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>Proclamation to the Anglo-French Expeditionary
Forces.</i></p>

<p>"Protected by a heavy fire of a powerful
fleet, you have been able to land on the
Gallipoli Peninsula on and since April 25.</p>

<p>"Backed up by those same men-of-war,
you could establish yourself at two points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
of the peninsula. All your endeavours to
advance into the inner parts of the peninsula
have come to failure under your heavy losses,
although your ships have done their utmost
to assist you by a tremendous cannonade,
implying enormous waste of ammunition.
Two fine British battleships, <i>Triumph</i> and
<i>Majestic</i>, have been sunk before your own
eyes by submarine boats, all protective
means against them being found utterly
insufficient. Since those severe losses to the
British Navy, men-of-war had to take refuge,
and have abandoned you to your own fate.</p>

<p>"Your ships cannot possibly be of any
help to you in future, since a great number
of submarines are prepared to suppress
them. Your forces have to rely on sea transport
for reinforcements and supply of food,
water, and every kind of war material.
Already the submarines have sunk several
steamers carrying supplies for your destination.
Soon all supplies will be entirely cut
off from your landed forces.</p>

<p>"You are exposed to certain perdition by
starvation and thirst. You could only escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
useless sacrifice of life by surrendering. We
are assured you have not taken up arms
against us by hatred. Greedy England has
made you fight under a contract. You may
confide in us for excellent treatment. Our
country disposes of ample provisions. There
is enough to feed you well and make you feel
quite at your comfort. Don't further hesitate.
Come and surrender.</p>

<p>"On all other fronts of this war, your
own people and your allies, the situation is
as hopeless as on this peninsula. All news
spread amongst you concerning the German
and Austrian armies are mere lies. There
stands neither one Englishman, nor one
Frenchman, nor one Italian on German soil.
On the contrary the German troops are keeping
a strong hold on the whole of Belgium
and on conspicuous parts of France since
many a month. A considerable part of Russian
Poland is also in the hands of the Germans,
who advance there every day. Early
in May, strong German and Austrian forces
have broken through the Russian centre in
Galicia. Przemysl has fallen back into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
their hands lately. They are not in the
least way handicapped by Italy's joining
your coalition, but are successfully engaged
in driving the Russians out of Galicia. These
Russian troops, whose co-operation one
moment you look forward to, are surrendering
by hundreds and thousands. Do as they do.
Your honour is safe. Further fighting is
mere stupid bloodshed."</p></div>

<p>Lovers of peace will regret to learn that the
hard-headed and ferocious Australians rejected
this kind invitation, and persisted in "stupid
bloodshed." Incidentally, it might be mentioned,
most of the blood shed was Turkish.</p>

<p>One other literary effort from our friend the
enemy reached us about the same time. It was
issued by the Director of the Military Museum
at Constantinople, and was to the following
effect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The public are hereby informed that the
700 British mitrailleuses and 300 French
cannon captured during the battle of Ari-Bournu
at Gallipoli by our heroic troops, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the course of bayonet charges in which they
drove into the sea and drowned more than
twenty thousand of the enemy, will be on
exhibit in the foreign gallery of the Museum
immediately after the cessation of hostilities."</p></div>

<p>This startling item of information was so
unexpected that it made us all long to get to
Constantinople to see the trophies of Turkish
prowess. It was solely with this object in view
that we began making fresh preparations for a
special trip to that city beautiful.</p>

<p class="mt2">Vignettes of battle!</p>

<p>These are the kaleidoscopic pictures that
remain mirrored in the memory. I have forgotten
what the transports looked like when we
reached Gallipoli. I only half remember the
panorama of battle when we first tackled the
Turk. Yet there is no forgetting these little
snapshots of soldiering, the vivid vignettes which
stand out in clear-cut silhouette against the background
of our experiences. Somehow they seem
more like tableaux vivants than a moving picture
show. Certainly the impression is not blurred
by action, so the mind, like a camera plate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
retains the scene down to the minutest details.
Perhaps, when we think of the big things that
our lads have done, these little visions may seem
hardly worth chronicling. But the Censor will not
let me take photographs, and after all it might
interest the old folks at home to scan these hurried
lines and construct their own mental pictures
of the rugged and inhospitable Gallipoli
Peninsula where so many young Australians
have fought and died for empire.</p>

<p>First, the Cove! It was in Anzac Cove we
first landed. In spite of the shrapnel shells
which burst on the beach or plunged into the
sea, we could take stock of the whole scene before
us&mdash;afloat and ashore. Straight ahead the hills
rose almost from the water's edge to a height of
400 feet. To right and left were the army stores:
little mountains of bully beef and biscuits.
Scores of soldiers moved hither and thither on
fatigue duty, giving Anzac the appearance of a
thriving port. At least five hundred men were
swimming in the Cove entirely indifferent to the
enemy's shells. Under the sheltering shadow of
the hill was the field ambulance&mdash;doctors working
overtime, orderlies running here and there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
stretcher-bearers coming and going with their
burdens of wounded and dead; seaward, transports
lolled lazily on the placid bosom of the
Mediterranean; torpedo boats streaked about
looking for submarines; warships wreathed in
battle-smoke belched broadsides; aloft, a circling
aeroplane.</p>

<p> ... There are weird names on Anzac.
Hell Spit, Shell Green, Casualty Corner, Valley
of Despair, The Bloody Angle, Dead Man's Hill,
Sniper's Nest, and Cooee Gully. Every name
conjures up memories. At the Bloody Angle
Turks and Australians were at death-grips, day
after day, and week after week, with the trenches
only a few yards apart. It was back through
the death-strewn Valley of Despair that the
Australian infantry withdrew after their first
glorious charge inland. On Dead Man's Hill the
Turks lay slaughtered in hundreds after their
fierce attack on May 19.</p>

<p>And we all know Shrapnel Valley. Here the
Light Horse lay all through the night of the 20th,
learning what shell-fire really meant. Since the
first landing on April 25 the Turks must have
landed tons and tons of lead and iron in Shrapnel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Valley, but we soon knew the safety spots and
the danger zones. The tortuous, waterless creek
bed wound its aimless way to the sea; steep
hills, scrub-faced, rose on either side; wild
flowers, pink and white and lilac and yellow
and blue, graced the uplands where we first
landed; but they were all gone now. On the
crest of the hill, sharply silhouetted against the
skyline, were our trenches, so manned that
the devils of hell could not break through, let
alone the turbaned and malignant Turk. On
the ledges behind&mdash;rather ragged and unkempt
now&mdash;lounged the reserves, ready in case of
attack, but knowing well that their comrades in
front could easily hold the line. MacLaurin's
Hill is at the top. A little further down projects
Braund's Hill. Little graves dot the hillside;
little wooden crosses mark the graves.</p>

<p> ... And then the Mules! Just mules and
donkeys; but they play no unimportant part in
the war game at Anzac. They too, with their
Indian attendants, landed at Anzac with only
the Turkish guns to voice a welcome. They
too sheltered in dug-outs when the artillery duel
waxed warm. But day after day, and night after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
night, they toiled for the transport. Water and
ammunition and stores of all kinds had to be
carried from the depots to the firing-line, and the
bulk of the burden fell on the mules. Along the
meandering paths they filed, scrambling up the
stiff pinches, resting awhile on the crests. Now
and then a shell would slaughter a few. Anon,
snipers' bullets would take toll. But the imperturbable
Indian would just carry on. We had
two little donkeys in Shell Green. They divided
their time between the 2nd Light Horse Brigade
and the 3rd Infantry Brigade, and the boys gave
them biscuits. Morning and evening the Turks
shelled our lines, and Shell Green was plastered
with pellets and splinters. Yet by some miraculous
chance the donkeys escaped harm. Men
were struck down on either side, but for a couple
of months the lucky animals escaped scatheless.
The soldiers swore by the donkeys' luck, and
when the shells burst stood by the animals rather
than fly for shelter. At last the luck turned.
A high explosive burst over thirty men, scattered
everywhere, wounded both donkeys, and
never touched a single man. We buried
one of the donkeys next day. The other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
wounded and lonely, wandered about disconsolate.</p>

<p> ... Night at Anzac! The sun, a sphere of
flaming red, sank into the sea. The western
horizon glowed rich and splendid, while the
waters of the Archipelago shimmered like molten
gold. Imbros and Samothrace stood out in bold
relief on the crimson skyline, while the coast of
distant Bulgaria softened till lost in a purple haze.
Down south spurts of fire and booming thunder
told of the British warships still hammering
away at the forts of the Dardanelles. Slowly,
there was unfolded for the millionth time the
miracle of nature's transformation scene. Like
a white-hot furnace cooling, the blazing west
turned to rose-red and amethyst, lilac and purple.
Faithful as an echo, the mirroring sea reflected
the softened shades of the sky, and the chastened
waters grew mystic and wonderful in the afterglow.
As the deepening twilight mantled the
Ægean Sea, twinkling lights appeared on land
and water, while one by one the little stars joined
the crescent moon for company. All blurred
and indistinct were the hills and hollows, and
during a brief respite from the never-ending
fusillade we forgot the war. But just behind was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the long line of Australian bayonets pointing
towards Constantinople.</p>

<p> ... The Guns! Thick-lipped and cold, cruel
and menacing, were the Guns of Anzac. Death-dealing
monsters were they, heartless and vindictive,
but, oh, how we soldiers loved them! For
they were our very best friends; field guns,
mountain guns and howitzers. We knew when
the German and Turkish artillerymen started
their snarling hymn of hate that our gunners
would soon be barking defiance. Enemy shells
might roar and thunder, and shrapnel claim its
victims; high explosives might wreck parapets
and trenches, but we knew our guns and our
gunners, and that was enough. We lay low
while the artillery duel raged overhead and the
echoing hills reverberated with the thunderous
roar of battle. So cunningly concealed were our
guns, with such acumen were our emplacements
selected and built that Tommy Turk had continually
to be guessing. His shells searched the
hills and the valleys in vain. His gunners too
were skilful and brave. They took position in
gullies, behind hills and in villages, and blazed
away at our lines. But our aeroplanes circled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
overhead to spot them. Then our guns got busy
and fired like fury till the Hun cried "Hold!"</p>

<p>Then when our spell in the trenches was over,
and we sought the seclusion of our dug-outs,
there came visions that are not vignettes of war.
I saw the old homestead in the Hunter Valley.
Hard by Erringhi it stands, where the Williams
River meanders through the encircling hills and
flows on towards Coalopolis. There are roses
'neath the old-fashioned windows, and in the
fields the scent of lucerne ripe for the scythe.
Magpies yodel in the big trees, and the wattle-gold
is showing down the river. I wonder will I
ever see dear old Erringhi again?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>"GEORGE"</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A RECAPITULATION&mdash;INTO THE FIRING-LINE&mdash;IN
SIGHT OF HISTORIC TROY&mdash;A WELL-FED ARMY&mdash;A
REAL GOOD COOK</p></div>


<p class="mt2">George was the cook.</p>

<p>He blew into the Light Horse Camp at
Holdsworthy when we were training. The staff
captain gave him the job because he was a sea
cook. Any man who can cook at sea ought to be
able to cook on dry land. And all through the
weary weeks of waiting and working, George
kept on cooking.</p>

<p>George was small, not to say puny. His height
was five feet, and his chest measurement nothing
to cable home about. Had he gone to Victoria
Barracks in the ordinary way to enlist he wouldn't
have passed even the sentry at the gate, let alone
the doctor. But George knew the ropes. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
had "soldiered" before. That's why he took the
short cut direct to camp.</p>

<p>We never saw much of him on the <i>Suevic</i>;
when off duty he used to climb to some cosy
corner on the uppermost deck and read dry textbooks
on strategy and tactics. At odd times he
would seek relaxation in <cite>Life of Napoleon</cite>,
<cite>Marlborough</cite>, or <cite>Oliver Cromwell</cite>, but this
was distinctly "not a study, but a recreation."
Passing through the Suez Canal we saw the Turks
miles away on the rim of the desert. George
got out his rifle, set the sight at 2,500 yards, and
waited. But the invader kept well out of range,
and George went back to his cooking.</p>

<p>It was mid-winter in Egypt and the nights
were bitterly cold. Greatcoats were vitally necessary.
How welcome were the mufflers and
Balaclava caps and warm socks knitted by the
girls we left behind us! Welcome also was the
hot coffee George provided to fill in the shivering
gap between réveillé and stables. And after
the horses had all been fed and watered, we returned
with zest to breakfast&mdash;porridge and
meat and "eggs a-cook" and bread and marmalade.
I've heard some grumblers complain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the "tucker" in Egypt, but I've seen a bit of war
by this and I'm convinced that the Australians
are the best-fed army in the world. And George
by the same token was not a bad cook.</p>

<p>Summer swooped down on Egypt. In its wake
came heat and dust and flies and locusts. Over
the scorching sands of the desert we cantered till
the sweat poured from us and our horses, and
the choking dust enveloped all. "Gyppie"
fruit-sellers scurried hither and yon yelling
"Oringes&mdash;gooud beeg one." And as we regaled
ourselves with the luscious thirst-quenchers we
thought of camp and the dinner that George was
preparing. We trekked along the Nile, and
almost before we halted George was boiling the
billy. We bivouacked at Aaron's Gorge, or the
Petrified Forest, or in a desert waste, and always
George was on the spot with his dixies and pans.
The cook's cart was a pleasing silhouette against
the pyramid-pierced skyline, when we turned
our eyes westward in the long summer evenings.</p>

<p>When at last we started for the Dardanelles, we
of the Light Horse Brigade had (as you know)
to leave our horses behind, and the cook's cart
stopped too. But George came along all right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Despite the activities of the submarines we reached
Gallipoli in safety, and witnessed the allied warships
pounding away at the Turkish defences.
Historic Troy was on our right; before us the
entrance to the Dardanelles; and on the left,
firmly established on Helles, was the great
Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, making its
first halt on the road to Constantinople. But we
had to go further north, a mile beyond Gaba
Tepe, where the Australians&mdash;particularly the
3rd Infantry Brigade&mdash;had performed such deeds
of valour that Dargai, Colenso, and Magersfontein
were declared by old soldiers to have been a mere
picnic in contrast.</p>

<p>We landed amid a hail of shrapnel. Transhipping
from the transports, we crowded into
launches and sweepers and barges. These little
boats, heavily laden with khaki freight, made
straight for Anzac Cove. Fair targets for Tommy
Turk, of course; so the guns of the Olive Grove
Battery sent us anything but peaceful messages.
Plug-plong went the shells into the water. Zip-zip
hissed the bullets all round us. But, marvellous
to relate, not a man was hit. Next day
some infantry reinforcements, landing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
same place and manner, sustained forty casualties.
That's the luck of the game&mdash;the fortune
of war. We landed everything satisfactorily.</p>

<p>George brought up the rear, with his pots and
dixies. It is because of George that I recapitulate.</p>

<p>In a long, straggling khaki line ("Column o'
lumps," said the brigade major) we meandered
past Casualty Point and Hell Spit, and up to our
bivouac in Shrapnel Valley. Snipers on the hill
up beyond Quinn's Post sent long-range shots
at random down the track. Shells burst over our
heads, and the leaden pellets spattered over the
landscape. It would take too long to recount
half the miraculous escapes some of our chaps
had. Our artillery worked overtime, and the
row was deafening. But our gunners could not
silence the elusive cannon in the Olive Grove.
After a time, wherein the minutes seemed like
hours, we reached the camp site, and started to
dig in feverishly. We burrowed like rabbits.
Picks, shovels and bayonets made the earth fly
till we had scratched a precarious shelter from
the blast. Like troglodytes we snuggled into the
dug-outs, waiting for the bombardment to cease.</p>

<p>But George went on with his cooking.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;"><a id="Bridges"></a>
  <img src="images/i_b_140fp.jpg" width="384" height="600" alt="Major-General W. T. Bridges." />
  <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Major-General W. T. Bridges.</span></span>
  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2">Next day we changed our quarters. The German
artillerymen were too attentive. We had
sustained a few casualties, so we sought a more
retired spot under the lee of the hill. For the
first time since we had landed we were able to
look about us. There was a lull in the cannonade,
though the musketry fusillade proceeded merrily.
We saw the long line of Australian and New
Zealand trenches whence the Turks had been
driven in rout the night before, leaving 3,000
dead to mar the landscape. We heard too,
definitely, for the first time of the good Australians
who on this inhospitable shore had given
their lives for King and Empire&mdash;General Bridges,
Colonel MacLaurin, Lieutenant-Colonel Braund,
Lieutenant-Colonel Onslow Thompson, Sergeant
Larkin (who used to sit on the opposite side to
Colonel Braund in the New South Wales Parliament,
but found in war the leveller that makes
us all one party), and hundreds of others. Looking
up to the precipitous cliffs above, we marvelled
anew at the reckless daring of our infantry
comrades who had scaled those heights in the face
of rifle, machine-gun and shrapnel.</p>

<p>But we had not long to saunter and wonder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Our brigade was sent straightway into the firing-line.
We were initiated into the mysteries of
trench warfare, sapping and mining, bombs and
grenades, observing and sniping, posies and dug-outs,
patrolling and listening, periscopes and
peepholes, demonstrations and reconnaissance,
supports and reserves, bully-beef and biscuits,
mud and blood and slaughter, and all the humours
and rumours, the hardships and horrors of war.</p>

<p>And all the time we were doing our little bit
George went on with his cooking. He may have
been thinking of Napoleon, or Marlborough, or
Cromwell, but he did not seem to be thinking
much about this war of ours&mdash;except that he had
to do some cooking for it. The Turks were shooting
many of our officers down, and many of our dear
old pals, but George remained&mdash;and we hoped
that they would spare him. Good cooks&mdash;real,
good cooks like George&mdash;are scarce.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>"ROBBO"</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A GREAT TRANSPORT OFFICER&mdash;HOW HE HANDLED
HORSES&mdash;AND HOW HE DIED&mdash;LIEUTENANT
HENRY ROBSON&mdash;A NORTH COAST HERO</p></div>


<p class="mt2">George and Bill, Tom and Dick and Harry&mdash;all
a happy family, having a wonderful
time. You never knew what was going to happen
next. At any moment your turn might come.
You could not tell. But you saw old pals in the
morning, and you didn't see them in the evening.
Sometimes the mate who had shared your tent
and fought alongside you in the trench&mdash;the
mate who was with you at Holdsworthy, who was
with you in Egypt, and laughed and joked with
you at Anzac&mdash;was suddenly snatched away from
you, and then you realized what a thin line it is
that separates life from death. Have you ever
dreamed that you were standing on the edge of a
precipice and that an enemy was racing along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
behind you to push you over? That was how
we felt during these days on Gallipoli. A moment,
and then you too might be falling headlong
down the precipice. But we found it best not to
let our minds dwell upon it.</p>

<p>So we went on burrowing into the side of the
hill. We banked up the sides of our dug-outs
with sandbags and tins and earth. Most of the
fighting was being done in the trenches. In some
places they were now 1,500 yards apart, in some
only twenty-one feet apart; and in the latter case
life was all excitement. It was sap and mine and
bomb and fusillade all the time. My brigade had
now been here for some time, and despite the "accidents"
which were always occurring we all had,
somehow or other, a feeling of absolute security.
We laughed at the Turks, and we smiled at what
Liman von Sanders said&mdash;that he would drive us
into the sea. We were just waiting, content and
confident, for the big move that was going to lead
to Constantinople!</p>

<p>And as I have said, we were a fairly well-fed
army. We had none of the luxuries that the
British Expeditionary Force had in France and
Flanders. But on the whole we did not do too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
badly. The brigadier ate the same "tucker" as
his batman.</p>

<p>We were given meat and vegetables and biscuits
and cheese and jam. If only we could have
had a lump of bread for a change! For the biscuits
were so hard that they could be used to
defend the trenches, if necessary&mdash;either as missiles
or as overhead cover. Colonel &mdash;&mdash; broke one
of his teeth on one. So we tried to soak them in our
tea. Then we made them into porridge.</p>

<p>There was fighting on land and sea, in the air
and under the water. Aeroplane reconnaissance
was a daily spectacle. Our airmen would go
aloft and have a good look at the enemy's position.
The enemy's guns would boom out all the
time, and shrapnel shells would burst all round
the 'plane without ever seeming to hit it.
We thought it was great sport watching the white
puffs of smoke where the shells burst. Then the
aeroplanes would drop bombs on the Turks for
spite&mdash;"throw-downs" we called them. Sometimes
the position was reversed, and the Germans
dropped bombs on us. Two can play at the same
game in war. Take the hand grenades. You
should have seen Corporal Renwick take them!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Before he became a soldier Renwick was well
known on the cricket field&mdash;as indeed were
hundreds of others&mdash;and on Gallipoli he used to
catch the bombs and throw them back before they
exploded. Nor was he the only one who did this.
It was like tossing live coals back and forth&mdash;playing
with fire. Some of our boys used to say
it was the best "slip practice" they ever had!
Sometimes a bomb would explode prematurely
and a man's fingers would be blown off, and
worse than that. But the others went on with
the game.</p>

<p>And we went swimming down at the beach,
just as if it had been Manly or Coogee. Only it
was more exciting: Shells took the place of
sharks. Instead of the sudden cry one would
sometimes hear at Manly or Coogee of "'Ware
shark," it was "'Ware shell!" The Turks are
not the surfers that the Australians are. They
had little sympathy with such healthy exercise,
and they showed their disapproval of it by opening
fire on the beach; and then there was a warning
whistle, and we all rushed in to shelter. Afterwards
we had the pleasure of initiating some
Turkish prisoners into the joys of surf-bathing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
but the majority of them did not take kindly to
it.</p>

<p>And all the time the fighting went on. One
night we had a great set-to. The Turks mined
one of our trenches and rushed in and captured
it. This was the affair at "Quinn's Post." We
counter-attacked and re-took the trench, killed
and captured some of the Turks, and then took
one of their trenches. Then the hand grenades
began to come, and the cricket commenced. It
was an exciting match. The Turks made a
determined attempt to recapture the position.
They charged in strong force, but our chaps all
along the line "hit them to leg." We enfiladed
them with rifle and machine-gun fire, and they
were eventually repulsed with a loss of about
2,000.</p>

<p>Wiggins, of the Field Ambulance, was sitting
in his dug-out, and two of his mates went out and
called to him. He leaned out and said: "Not
yet; the shrapnel hasn't stopped." Then a
shrapnel shell passed between the other two and
struck him on the head and killed him.</p>

<p>Life and death! A very thin line.... One
never knows. "In the morning the grass groweth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
up, in the evening it is cut down and withered."</p>

<p>One day the word went round that "Robbo"
had been killed. We would not believe it at
first. It seemed a silly lie, one of those baseless
camp rumours that some fool starts for a
joke. Some of the officers went round to see for
themselves. Colonel Cox stood by the dug-out,
looking old and stricken. "Robbo's killed," he
said. Then we knew it was true. Alas, alas, here
was a loss! For "Robbo" was great.</p>

<p>The Turks had been subjecting us to a heavy
bombardment for some days, and our artillery
had been responding vigorously. Mostly their
shells buried themselves in the sides of the hills,
or exploded somewhat harmlessly in the air.
Then one unlucky shrapnel shell burst right over
the headquarters of the 6th Light Horse Regiment&mdash;and
"Robbo" was there.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Henry Robson lay on the floor of
the dug-out, a shrapnel bullet in his breast. And
we who had lived with him in camp and on the
march for eight strenuous months, sorrowed as
keenly as will his North Coast friends. To Colonel
Cox it was not only the loss of an officer; it was
also the loss of an old friend who years before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
had shared the dangers of battles and the stress of
war.</p>

<p>All of us liked Lieutenant Robson. His bark
was far worse than his bite. He'd give a shirking
soldier the full force of his tongue, but his heart&mdash;"right
there" as "Tipperary" has it&mdash;was
in the right place. Kind of heart, genial of
temper, and always willing to help others along,
we mourn a man that can ill be spared. He was
reckoned the best transport officer in Egypt. He
knew horses as few men did. Australians are
reputed to be good horsemen, but poor horse-masters.
But Lieutenant Robson was good all
round with horses. He would get more work
out of a team than any one I know. He could get
a full measure of work from his men also. But he
never overdrove man or beast. That's why we
liked him.</p>

<p>Harry Robson was forty-eight years of age
when he died a soldier's death on Gallipoli
Heights. He was one of the original Northern
River Lancers, and went to England with the
New South Wales Lancers in 1893. Later on he
went home with the Lancers under Colonel Cox
in 1899. Standing six feet two in his socks, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
was as straight as the lance he carried. He
was an expert swordsman, and won several
prizes at the tournaments in Scotland and
at Islington. At tent-pegging he was an acknowledged
champion. On the transport and in
Egypt we had many bouts with the sword and
singlesticks, but none of the younger officers could
worst Robson, although he was old enough to be
their father.</p>

<p>When the South African war broke out, he was
sergeant-major in the New South Wales Lancers
under Colonel Cox, they being the first Colonial
troops to land at the Cape. He went right
through the war, and participated in the battles
of Modder River, Magersfontein, Grasspan, Paardeberg,
Driefontein, and the Relief of Kimberley.
He was with French's column during the main
advance. When the 3rd Imperial Mounted
Rifles were formed, Lieutenant Robson became
transport officer under Colonel Cox, and saw a lot
of service in Natal, the Orange Free State, and
Eastern Transvaal. He participated in Kitchener's
big drives, wherein his resourcefulness was
of great help to the column. On one occasion
Remington's column was held up by an impassable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
boggy morass. The Inniskillens and Canadians
were bogged. The Australians halted.
Lieutenant Robson improvised a crossing with
bales of hay and reeds, and got his transport over
while the others were wondering how far round
they would have to go. On another occasion in
the Transvaal, by a simple device, he crossed
the Wilge River with all his mules and wagons
at a place reckoned absolutely hopeless for
wheeled transport.</p>

<p>After the South African war he settled down on
the Northern Rivers, and prospered. But when
this great cataclysm convulsed the world, he
heard the call of Empire, and responded like a
patriot. He wired to Colonel Cox, offering his
services, and left the comforts of home for the
discomforts of war. On board the transport he
was most painstaking and zealous in the performance
of his duties. At Ma'adi he had his
transport running as smoothly as a machine.
When we found we were going without our
horses, we thought that Lieutenant Robson would
be left behind. But at the last moment the
regimental quartermaster fell ill, and Robson
filled the breach. And so for nine weary weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
of fighting he looked after the needs of the
regiment, and not one trooper ever went to bed
hungry. (I say "bed," but none of us has seen
a bed for many months.)</p>

<p>As quartermaster, there was no need for him
to be poking about the trenches and up in the
firing-line as he did. But it was not in the firing-line
he was killed. That is the fortune of war.
He was standing just near headquarters watching
the warships gliding over the Ægean Sea.
Then came the fatal shell, and "Robbo" passed
out to the Beyond.</p>

<p>TRENCH LIFE&mdash;THE SNIPER IS BORN&mdash;HOLIDAY ON
A HOSPITAL SHIP&mdash;"WAR IS HELL"&mdash;SHIFTING
SCENES&mdash;NOTHING IMPOSSIBLE&mdash;HEAVY
FIGHTING&mdash;DEATH AND BURIAL OF A GALLANT
OFFICER</p></div>


<p class="mt2">We were told at the outset that the trenches
were the safest place to be in, and this
is quite true. Shrapnel now and then knocks
down the parapets and does a little damage, but
in Shrapnel Valley and Suicide Walk it bursts
at all times. And even in the dug-outs one is not
wholly safe. Many a brave spark has gone out
in the dug-outs. The Turks have their snipers,
and we have ours, as the sea hath its pearls. A
good sniper is indeed a pearl&mdash;unless he is fighting
on the "other side," and in that case he is "a
cow." Most of us try our hand at sniping, with
more or less success&mdash;climbing up and down
these hills in search of what we call "big game"&mdash;but
although I am a tolerable shot myself, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
have come to the conclusion that your true
sniper, like your true poet, is born, not made. I
have heard it said that a good tennis-player
makes a good sniper (providing he can shoot)
because he has the knack of anticipating his
opponent's movements. It is not enough to see
your man and have a "pot" at him, for the
chances are that just as you let go, he stoops down
to pick a pretty flower, or he stumbles over a
scrub-root. Now, the successful sniper is he
who anticipates that stumble, or with an uncanny
sort of second sight sees that pretty flower which
the enemy gentleman is going wantonly to pluck,
and aims low accordingly. Only by some such
sort of intelligent anticipation could some of our
men have put up the astonishing records that
stand to their credit. But of that more anon.</p>

<p>Just at the moment I am out of the firing-line,
and it is time enough to write of snipers and shot
and shell when I get back to it&mdash;lots of time.
For the present I am otherwise engaged. I have
seen a girl&mdash;several of them&mdash;real girls&mdash;beautiful
girls. To one who has not seen a girl for nearly
six weeks girls seem wonderful. It is a red-letter
day. For the first time for five weeks I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
feel absolutely safe from snipers and shells. I'm
on the hospital ship <i>Gascon</i>, a couple of miles off
Anzac. No, I'm not sick, neither am I wounded;
it is just a little matter of duty that has brought
me over, and I'm having a glorious holiday&mdash;two
hours of real holiday. Presently I shall go
back to my little grey home in the trench; and
so I am enjoying every minute of my time on
the ship. After weeks of bully-beef and bacon
and biscuits I have had a <span class="smcap">DINNER</span>. Can you who
live at home at ease realize what that means?
I had soup, fish, grilled chop, sausage, potatoes,
rhubarb tart, cheese, bread and butter, coffee&mdash;fit
for a king! Before dinner I hungrily watched
the stewards as they walked in and out of the
saloon. And after dinner I bought two cigars for
two shillings and smoked the smoke of absolute
peace and contentment.</p>

<p>I quite forgot the war. I could scarcely hear
the sound of the fusillade and bombardment of
Anzac, and I kept on the other side of the ship
so that I should not see the place. The only
thing to remind me of the war was the occasional
booming of the guns of our warships. After the
trenches it was just like heaven. The view was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
delightful. Imbros, Samothrace and Tenedos were
near by. The sea was smooth; the weather perfect,
the blue of the sky rivalling the blue of the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>And the girls! There were nurses on board.
I shook hands with them all and talked to half a
dozen of them. One was a very sweet little thing&mdash;an
angel! I longed for a broken arm or leg, so
that I might stay there.... Come, shade of
brave old Sir Walter, and help me here.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O, woman! In our hours of ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And variable as the shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the light quivering aspen made;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When pain and anguish wring the brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A ministering angel thou!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But they are all angels, ministering angels, tending
the sick and wounded, whispering sweet words
into the ears of brave men who lie there, suffering
tortures of mind and body, but never uttering
a complaint.</p>

<p>There were several doctors on board, and
quite a lot of officers and men, some wounded,
others sick and broken down with the stress of
the last few weeks. Several of our brigade were
among them. Heroes all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, I felt that if anything happened to me I
should like to be taken aboard that hospital ship.
But nothing had happened to me worth recording&mdash;only
a few narrow escapes such as we all have
in war time. I never felt better in my life. My
appetite was of the best. My tongue had no coat
of fur upon it. I had no excuse for remaining.
I commandeered a few sheets of paper and some
envelopes (precious things!). I went in and had
a <span class="smcap">BATH</span>&mdash;none of your ordinary swims, with one
eye on the shrapnel and the other on the shore,
but a real bath with soap and fresh water&mdash;and
then I said good-bye to the nurses, good-bye to
the doctors and the men, and went back from
this heaven on the water to that hell upon the
earth.</p>

<p>It <span class="smcap">WAS</span> hell! All war is hell, as General Sherman
said. And there never was one that better
deserved the name than this one. Oh, God! I
have stood on Braund's Hill admiring the sunset
views, when the islands of the Ægean Sea seem to
be floating on the edge of a gorgeous canvas of
shimmering gold, and I have stood on other hills
and watched the dawn-blush and the rising sun,
and I have said to myself, What a blot upon God's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
beauties is war!... And then I have taken
up my rifle and gone forth to kill men! Every
prospect pleases and only the enemy is vile. Oh,
these shifting scenes and changing moods!</p>

<p>On the other side were forty thousand Turks
(we are told) watching for the opportunity to kill
us. Our mission was to get to Constantinople;
theirs to drive us into the sea. We were "dug
in"; they were "dug in." If we found it a
long, long way to Constantinople, they were finding
it's a long way to the sea, which is much
nearer as the crow flies. They shivered at the
sound of our land guns; they heard the broadsides
of our ships; they watched the <i>Queen
Elizabeth</i> fire her 15-inch gun; the shells landing
on the sides of the hills, tossing hundreds of tons
of earth and rock high into the air, so that when
the smoke cleared away they would not know
those hills; and they trembled, as all men who
have seen have trembled at the fury of the monstrous
gun!</p>

<p>But they fought on. Every yard of ground
won cost us dear. I have seen our boys fall like
ninepins before a hail of bullets. I have heard
the cry "Lie low" in an advance, and every man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
has fallen flat upon the ground to escape certain
destruction; and I have heard that other pitiful
cry, time and time again, of "Stretcher-bearers
wanted!" Once the men lay prone for four
hours in the midst of the scrub, with the air full
of bursting shells and rifle and machine-gun fire
passing just over them. I do not wonder that
some men lost their nerve during those terrible
hours.</p>

<p>But never yet did Australian officer call upon
his men to take a position, no matter how impossible
the feat, and find them wanting. "Impossible!"
There was no such word in their
vocabulary. Nothing was impossible to them&mdash;until
they died. Colonel McCay, Brigadier in
Command of the Second Infantry Brigade, spoke
the truth when he said: "The way, the cheerful,
splendid way, they face death and pain is simply
glorious, and if no Australian ever fought again,
April 25, April 26 and May 8 specially mark them
as warriors. On the eighth of May I said in effect
to them (my own brigade), 'Come and die,' and
they came with a cheer and a laugh. They are
simply magnificent."</p>

<p>The men were led by brave officers&mdash;officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
who would not ask their men to go where they
themselves were afraid to go. It was thus,
leading their men to the fight, that General Sir
William Throsby Bridges, commanding the Australian
Imperial Force when it made its historic
landing, Colonel MacLaurin, Colonel Onslow
Thompson, Lieutenant-Colonel Braund, and other
gallant officers fell. And it was thus that, later,
Colonel McCay received the wounds that put him
out of action. Australian officers, like any other
officers, are human and have erred at times, but
they have never asked their men to take risks
they would not share themselves. There is a
letter written by Colonel McCay in which he says:
"When my men have to go into a veritable hell,
as they did on April 25, April 26 and May 8, I
must lead them, not send them. I won their
confidence because I shared the risks with them."
And that is the spirit of all the Australian officers&mdash;gallant
leaders of gallant men.</p>

<p>Such was the spirit of Lieutenant-Colonel
Hubert Harris, V.D., commanding the 5th
Light Horse Regiment, who was killed in action
on Gallipoli on the night of July 31. Curious it
was that the only man hit in the regiment that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
night was its commander. They were firing
from the trenches and occupying the attention
of the Turks while the infantry on our left blew
up the enemy's trench, dashed out, bayoneted the
defenders, and captured the position. There was
a wild fusillade by the enemy's riflemen, and a
heavy bombardment of our lines. One unlucky
bullet came through a loophole, struck Colonel
Harris in the neck, and he died in a few minutes.</p>

<p>There was heavy fighting along the whole
league-long line that night. But the main work
was left to MacLagan's famous 3rd Infantry
Brigade. The Turks had sapped in and dug
trenches opposite Tasmania Post. They looked
dangerous, and it was thought they would try to
undermine our trenches and blow us up. So we
mined in under them, and blew up their advanced
trench. On our left the New Zealanders made a
lively demonstration to keep the enemy opposite
engaged, and the big guns blazed away at the
main Turkish position. From the sea a warship
fired high explosives in the same direction. Then
Captain Lean with a storming party of the 11th
Infantry Battalion, dashed out with great gallantry
and seized the objective. They used boards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
to surmount the barbed wire entanglements,
swept down on the Turks, bayoneted and shot
about fifty of them, and entered into possession.
Engineers immediately bolted out under a heavy
fire, and hurriedly built up sandbag defences.
And having got it, the Eleventh held on.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on the
right poured a heavy fire into the Turkish trenches
on the immediate left of the captured position.
All attempts at reinforcing the Turkish advanced
line were thus frustrated, and no counter-attack
had any chance of getting home. Thinking a
further attack was intended from Ryrie's Post,
the Turkish artillery concentrated their field
guns on the Light Horse, and the bombardment
was terrific; yet&mdash;and here is the luck of the
game&mdash;not one man in the firing-line of the 6th
Light Horse was wounded. I was up with B
Squadron, and the hail of shrapnel was something
to remember. That was about half-past ten at
night; and the moon having just risen, we concentrated
our rifle fire on the enemy's trenches,
leaving our artillery to deal with their reserves.
Then it was that the fatal bullet killed Colonel
Harris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>In a special order issued by General Birdwood
next day reference was made to the excellent
qualities of Colonel Harris, and to the conspicuous
ability he had shown during the few months he
had led his regiment on Gallipoli. We of the
Sixth knew his value, and liked him; the Queenslanders
loved him, and would have followed
him anywhere.</p>

<p>Colonel Harris was a comparatively young
man, not yet forty-five years of age. He started
his soldiering in the Brisbane Grammar School
cadets, and then became a bugler in the Queensland
Rifles. Later on he joined the Mounted
Infantry, volunteered for the South African War,
going with the second Queensland contingent as
a lieutenant, and returned a captain. He maintained
his interest in the military forces after his
return, became adjutant, and later on succeeded
to the command of the 13th Australian Light
Horse Regiment. Curiously enough, Colonel
Spencer Brown, whom he succeeded in that command,
and Lieutenant-Colonel Stoddart, who
succeeded him, have also come to the war. For
five years, Lieutenant-Colonel Harris commanded
the 13th Regiment, and then was placed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
unattached list. When the war broke out he
offered his services, and in November, 1914, took
command of the 5th Light Horse Regiment in
Colonel (now Brigadier-General) Ryrie's 2nd
Brigade. He wore the Victoria Decoration and
the Queen's South African ribbon with five clasps.</p>

<p>So here in the hills of Gallipoli there passes to
the Great Beyond another good Australian, a
brave and gallant officer, a kindly and courteous
gentleman. The Americans used to sing "John
Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave; his
soul goes marching on." So the 5th Regiment
may well feel that the spirit of Hubert Harris
will go with them on to victory.</p>

<p>We buried him next night. The Dean of Sydney,
Chaplain-Colonel Talbot, officiated, assisted
by Chaplain-Captain Gordon Robertson. Officers
and men of the regiment&mdash;all who could be spared
from the trenches&mdash;attended with Major Wilson,
who assumed command of the Fifth. Brigadier-General
Ryrie and staff, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Arnott, of the Seventh, were also present. As
the earth was heaped upon him, the brigadier
remarked sadly: "The brigade has lost a gallant
officer, and Australia a patriot."</p>

<span class="i0">With the tow-row-row-row-ri-ro,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The British Grenadiers!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A year or more ago, when we sang this old
song, we thought that the days of the
grenadiers were numbered, that future warfare
would know them no more.</p>

<p>Yet here we were on Gallipoli, reverting to the
grenades of the Peninsular War, and the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Roman catapult, and even the bows and arrows.
The enemy was so close to us that we could not
use some of our guns to demolish his trenches.
We even had to take some of our howitzers back
a mile in order to hit the enemy in front of us.
What a conglomeration of anomalies this war
presents! In an age when our big guns can hurl
huge projectiles many miles, we are compelled
to fight with bows and bayonets and bombs and
brickbats.</p>

<p>Bricks were not often used. But when the
Turkish snipers "sneaked" close up to our lines
through the scrub, we threw stones at the likely
places. Thinking these missiles were bombs,
the Turk would often run, or else disclose his
position. Then we gave him a few rounds rapid.</p>

<p>One day a German aeroplane flew along the
coast, and in plain view of the army dropped a
huge bomb at our hospital ship, only missing the
target by about fifty yards. There were no
other ships near, so there was no excuse. This
cowardly act so incensed our medical officer that
he went straight out to our firing-line and threw
a brick at the Turks, forty yards off. "I wear
the Red Cross," he apologized, "so I cannot fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
at them, and they are not supposed to fire on me.
But I must show my indignation somehow."</p>

<p>As to the bows and arrows: this was Major
Midgley's idea. At night the Turkish patrols
crawled up close to our lines, and sniped away
without being seen. Our flares could not be
thrown far enough to show them up. So we made
bows out of pine saplings and wire and sent
fiery arrows into the scrub. This made the unwelcome
visitors keep a respectful distance.</p>

<p>But if bows and bricks were only incidentals,
the bombs were the real thing. In the wild
bayonet charges our footballers were simply
irresistible. But with the bombs our cricketers
excelled. One of them exclaimed: "We've got
the cows bluffed." Another boasted: "We've
got 'em beaten to a frazzle"&mdash;shade of Roosevelt!
Anyhow, our chaps could beat the Turks
at the bomb business. Have I not already told
how some of our cricketers caught the enemy's
bombs and hurled them back again?</p>

<p>There was a picture&mdash;in <cite>Punch</cite> I think&mdash;of
the incident of the Irishman who yelled out to
the Germans, "How many of yez are there?"
and on getting the answer "T'ousands," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
heaved a bomb, saying, "Well, share that
amongst ye!" The Australians have quite the
same humorous appreciation of the situation.
With the trenches anything between 10 and 1,000
yards apart, there was ample scope for the passing
of compliments as well as bombs between the
contending forces. It was quite common for a
trooper to cry out: "Are you there, Abdul?
Well, here's baksheesh." Or may be, "Here you
are, Mohammed, here's a Christmas box"; and a
hand grenade would accompany the sally. When
a Turkish bomb arrived the Australian merely
observed: "Maleesch," or "Ver' good, ver'
nice," in imitation of the "gyppie" dragoman.
If a bomb exploded right in the trench or on the
parapet the real Australian "Slanguage" was
sure to be heard. One Light Horseman was
heard to observe as a bomb exploded over his
head: "These Turks are clumsy cows; they'll
be killing some of us if they ain't more careful!"
Once the voice of a Hun sounded from a Turkish
trench: "Come on you&mdash;kangaroo-shooters!"
But prisoners told us that the
German officers were rarely seen in the firing-line.
They felt safer further back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>A curious incident happened in the infantry
lines. A kangaroo-shooter from the Kimberley
country threw a bomb at a Turkish trench only
fifteen yards away, and the cries of "Allah,"
"Allah," told him that his aim was true. He turned
to his mates and remarked casually, "That's the
first man I've killed without getting into a heap
of trouble." A much more unsophisticated
youth&mdash;one of the recent reinforcements&mdash;had
been a week in the trenches without actually
seeing one of the enemy. Then a Turk jumped
on the parapet, threw a bomb, and jumped
down again. And the guileless one exclaimed,
"That's the first Turk I've seen in his wild
state!"</p>

<p>Lieutenant Massie, the giant Varsity cricketer,
son of the General Manager of the Commercial
Banking Company of Sydney&mdash;known in the
1st Brigade as "Massive"&mdash;was throwing bombs
one night (he can throw bombs farther than any
man on Gallipoli), and after landing a few in the
Turkish trenches, he accidentally struck his hand
on the back of the trench. The bomb he was
about to throw rolled along the bottom of the
trench and then exploded. Everybody in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
vicinity bolted to the nearest traverse, so no one
was hurt badly. But Massie was kept busy
for a week picking bomb splinters out of himself.</p>

<p>Massie had several miraculous escapes since
landing on Gallipoli. The closest shave occurred
when he was out in front of the firing-line fixing
some barbed wire. He was clambering back over
the parapet when one of his own men mistook
him for a Turk and lunged at him with his bayonet.
Massie ducked just as if he were dodging a
"straight left," but the point of the bayonet
caught him in the neck, inflicting, fortunately,
only a slight wound. Later he was seriously
wounded, and was taken off to hospital.</p>

<p>There was one senior officer in the Light Horse
who occasionally enjoyed fresh fish for breakfast.
This was very rare on Gallipoli. The cook would
never tell whence the fish came, but it was noted
that the regimental supply of bombs was always
one or two short. Nobody ever connected the
absence of bombs with the presence of fish.
But one morning very early the officer noticed
the cook making stealthily in the direction of the
cove. He followed. Then he saw the bombs
explode in the water, and he saw the cook swim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
out and gather in half a dozen fine big mullet.
An hour later he had delicious fresh fish for breakfast,
while most of the officers had bully-beef
and bacon. The officer was in a quandary. He
did not know whether to court-martial the cook
or promote him!</p>

<p>One other bomb incident I hesitate to give, as
I did not see it, and cannot vouch for it. But up
at Quinn's Post they swore it was true. I give
it in the words of the callous-hearted soldier who
told me the story. "We were giving Abdul a
'bit of hurry-up up' at Quinn's," he said.
"Jim always was slow, and it settled him. He
had a 5-seconds bomb, made out of a 'baccy'
tin, and he was told to count one, two, three, and
on the 'three' chuck the blame thing into the
Turkish trenches. Well, he lit it, and it never
burned too good, so he starts blowing at the fuse.
He looked awful comical, and we yelled at him to
'shot.' But he kept on blowing till the dash
thing exploded, and blew half his head off. He
was a humorous bloke."</p>

<p class="mt2">"My turn at cooking comes round every

the safest place to be in. One 8-inch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>shell took the roof (blankets) off our officers'
heads, just missing Major Hunt, O.C., Lieutenant
Smith and Lieutenant Perry, of our Company,
by inches&mdash;not the whole shell, but a piece of it.
The shell killed a couple of our men when it burst....
We were continuously at it for five solid
weeks, and then we were taken to Rest Gully for
a rest, which consisted of fatigues, sapping,
trenching under fire and working parties on the
famous beach, where 'Beachy Bill' and 'Lonely
Liz' used to scatter men by the score, with also
an 11-inch shell dropping now and then from the
Straits. Splendid rest, this!"</p>

<p>Change! What change could one have there?
Rest! What rest? "The Angel of Death is
abroad throughout the land," said John Bright
in one of his most memorable orations. "You
can almost hear the beating of his wings!" But
on Gallipoli you could hear the beating of his
wings day and night, knowing not what the next
moment might bring forth.</p>

<p>There were three mates in Junee, a western
town of New South Wales, who used to play
cricket and football together. When their country
asked for soldiers they answered the call.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
The three enlisted together, shared the same tent
in camp, and fought side by side in each successive
engagement, from the landing to the fight
for Lonesome Pine. One of them&mdash;Reg. Humphreys&mdash;fell
with a bullet in his brain, and died
in the arms of his comrade, Joe Charlton. Later
in the day, Charlton fell, and the third man,
Paul White, carried him back to the ship, where
he died of his wounds. Out of 120 men of A Company
only White and one other man remained.
The rest were all killed or wounded or sick.</p>

<p>Such is War. And yet our boys went cheerfully
on with their work. Hard work&mdash;hot
work, so hot that we followed the example of the
Indian Army and cut our trousers short. Very
comfortable were these "shorts" when climbing
about the hills. We looked like Boy Scouts.
You should have seen the gunners on a hot day,
stripped to the waist, and stripped from the knee
to the feet&mdash;wearing their "shorts" and nothing
but their "shorts"! Infantry and Light Horsemen,
you could scarce tell one from the other.
"Shorts" put us all on the same level. And we
were all as jolly as sandboys, having our fun and
cracking our jokes, reading the official <cite>Peninsula Press</cite>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> and enjoying the unofficial humour of our
own trench organs, such as the <cite>Dinkum Oil
News</cite> and <cite>The Dardanelles Driveller</cite>. We knew
that Death was near, but we laughed in his face.</p>

<p>One day a bread ration was issued, instead of
the inevitable biscuit ration. "Well, they might
have given us butter with it!" exclaimed one
trooper, with a smile. "Butter!" cried his mate&mdash;"you'll
be wanting flowers on your grave next!"</p>

<p>They had many names for the Australians on
Gallipoli, and one of them was "The Linguists."
Some of the British Tommies used to stand in
awe when they heard an Australian bullock
driver giving vent to his feelings. I have even
heard it said that a reputable Australian curate
who went to the front in the ranks used the most
disreputable language in charging a Turkish
trench. One morning a German aeroplane
dropped two huge bombs behind our lines. They
exploded with a terrific blast, but did no damage.
As the glistening bombs shot earthward, one of
the men exclaimed, "'Ere comes 'er 'ymn of 'ate
from 'ell!"</p>

<p>Another day we thought we would see an aerial
duel. Already we had seen about everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
else that twentieth-century war could show us.
But the duel never came off. One of our 'planes
took wing and flew north from Helles, over
Anzac, towards Enos. Shortly afterwards, a
German aeroplane took the air, and hovered over
our lines. Evidently our airman could not see
the Taube, for he circled aimlessly about over
the Ægean Sea. Meanwhile, the German got
quite venturesome. He sailed low&mdash;barely 2,000
feet above us&mdash;and though we blazed away with
rifles and guns, he managed to have a good look
at our position. Also, he dropped a couple of
bombs at the right of our line before he bolted.
But they fell harmlessly into the sea.</p>

<p>We got several good laughs every day. It
made life worth living to note the wonderful
good humour of our soldiers. Sometimes we
laughed at the Turks, sometimes at each other.
We had one great laugh at a German airman.
He went up with a big bomb, evidently intent
on some frightfulness. A British aeroplane
immediately sighted him, and started in pursuit.
Then a couple of French airmen took the air,
and joined in the chase. With three of them
hot on his trail, the German fled over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Turkish lines. The Allies gained on him, so to
lighten his load he dropped his bomb overboard.
But it landed on the Turkish trenches.
They thought he must have been an enemy,
for they at once opened fire with rifles,
machine-guns, and anti-aircraft artillery, and
the poor Taube had a very sultry time.</p>

<p>The Germans erected a new aerodrome, "somewhere
on Gallipoli." The French airmen sighted
it, dropped a few bombs, set fire to the petrol
store, and did considerable damage. We had
an aerial night attack on the Turkish camps at
the Soghan Dere. Our aeroplanes first fired
with their machine-guns at the flashes of the
enemy's rifles. Then they dropped a couple of
20-lb. bombs, which burst in the centre of the
Turkish camp. Finally they dropped 300 arrows
amongst the bewildered enemy.</p>

<p>After watching the airmen operating over the
Suez Canal and the Mediterranean, and in Gallipoli,
we came to the conclusion that flying is
easily the safest job in war time. We used to
think otherwise. To the onlooker it appeared so
hazardous, that the marvel was that those dare-devils
were not all blown to smithereens. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
for about three months, we watched them at work,
and not a hair of one of their heads was harmed.
Time and again the airman sailed across the
enemy's lines, while their anti-aircraft guns
worked overtime. The blue of the sky was
flecked with white puffs of smoke where the shells
burst, yet the aeroplane flew on serenely. I
counted forty-one shells one day, which burst
all round one of our airmen on reconnaissance.
Many seemed to go very close indeed; others
flew wide of the mark. The Turkish trenches
would spring to life as our 'planes passed over,
and thousands of rounds would be poured into
the atmosphere. Their machine-guns would
sound the rataplan as the belts were emptied.
But the wild fusillade never disconcerted the airmen.
All of which proves what an exceedingly
difficult target the aeroplane must be.</p>

<p>We did not have any Zeppelins buzzing round
the Dardanelles. Perhaps they were too busily
engaged on their baby-killing enterprises on the
east coast of old England. The nearest thing we
had was an observation balloon, looking for all
the world like a huge German sausage suspended
in mid-air. But it was very helpful to our warships
for observation purposes.</p>

<p class="mt2">In the training camps in Australia the chaplains
conducted services, helped at the concerts,
and generally made themselves useful and
agreeable. On the transports they did pretty
much the same thing; but somehow we never
seemed to know them, and they, in turn, knew
very few of us by name. It was when we settled
down in Egypt that we first began to know them,
and to appreciate their work. And since Cairo
has the reputation of being the wickedest city in
the world, there was ample scope for the operations
of the chaplains.</p>

<p>But one of the chaplains had adamantine ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
on theological subjects. He was a great scholar,
and had other virtues, but his conscience would
not let him participate in the combined services
with the other ministers. So when we came away
to thrash the Turk we left him behind in Egypt.</p>

<p>In his stead we took an Irishman&mdash;Father Bergin.
He was a good sport, a good priest,
brave as a lion, and with wounded soldiers gentle
as a nurse. His only fault was that he always
wanted to be right up in the firing line, for he
dearly loved a "scrap"&mdash;being Irish. When the
5th Light Horse Regiment had their fight near
Gaba Tepe, Father "Mike" was everywhere
tending the wounded, and as a water-carrier he
rivalled Gunga Din. Those of us who were not
of the "faithful" learned to like him more and
more, and if the campaign had lasted much
longer I fear we would have all been "Romans."</p>

<p>Then there was Captain Robertson, young and
quiet, and kind of heart. I don't think any of
us ever saw him in a pulpit. Mostly he had to
preach in tents or in the open air. I have heard
him hold forth in an Anzac gully, with the shells
bursting overhead. Again, I have sat at his feet
right in the support trenches, just behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
firing-line, while his sentences were punctuated by
the report of snipers' rifles. He used to dwell
on "historic associations." He told us that our
feet had trod the same streets and fields as Moses
and Aaron and Pharaoh, Joseph and Mary, the
Apostle Paul, Antony and Cleopatra, Helen of
Troy, Mahomet Ali, Napoleon and Byron, and a
host of others. His forte, however, was not
preaching, but practising. He practised most
of the Christian virtues. He was the soldiers'
friend, and when we'd sit and smoke and yarn
round the camp fire at night, and some one swore
inadvertently, he was not righteous overmuch.</p>

<p>Our third padre, the Senior Chaplain of the
Brigade, was Captain Keith Miller. As the
Americans say, he was "some preacher." At
Ma'adi we used to have the big tent packed with
2,000 soldiers. Visitors from Cairo and beyond
used to go from our services as much impressed
with the preacher as with the physique and bearing
of the Light Horsemen. Sermon-tasters
from St. Andrew's, Cairo, nodded their heads in
grave approval. Elders, with an air of finality,
said, "Yon's a fine deliverance"; and other
elders answered "Aye." The padre's final oration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
and peroration before we left for the front
won the special commendation of General Birdwood,
who was present. I forget now what the
sermon was about&mdash;but I know I wanted to cheer
at the end of it.</p>

<p>On one of the Turkish prisoners captured, we
found a copy of a divisional order, in which the
O.C. stated:&mdash;"I have many times been round
the fire trenches, but have never met any Imam.
I lately gave an order that Imams were to be constantly
in the trenches, in order to keep up the
morale of the men by preaching and exhorting;
and whenever possible men should be assembled
for prayer, and the call for prayer should be cried
by a fine-voiced Imam."</p>

<p>Now, it is pleasing to record that no such order
was necessary in the ranks of the Australian
division. Our chaplains since the memorable day
of the landing played their part manfully in the
great game. McKenzie of the Salvation Army
was real grit; one of the finest of our militant
Churchmen. They were in the trenches day and
night, talking with the men, writing letters home
to their people, visiting the sick; and every man
in our brigade was supplied with a neat little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
pocket Testament by a friend of the New South
Wales Auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible
Society. And on Sundays there were services in
all the brigades&mdash;in the gullies, or under the crests
of the hills behind the firing line. And sometimes
we couldn't hear the singing because of the
cannons' roar; there was not one solitary spot
in Anzac absolutely safe from the enemy's fire.
And yet I have never heard of any soldier being
wounded at any of these services! Once Padre
Miller was conducting a service in Shrapnel
Valley, and had finished his firstly, secondly, and
thirdly, and was just coming to the peroration,
when shrapnel shells burst overhead. So the
service had to be abandoned. That was a "sair"
trial to the "Meenister."</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of his many estimable qualities, I
regret to state that Padre Miller had one besetting
sin. It was a secret sin. Only a few of us knew
of his weakness. He played chess. Yes, played
chess over and over and over again. When in
Cairo others of us would play tennis, he would
slink away with some old crony and play chess. I
have known him play till two o'clock in the morning
at a game. (There is no doubt about the hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
because he called for me on the way back to
camp.) He was often late at mess, playing
chess. He scarce had time to dress, playing chess.
Admittedly he played well, and after defeating
the Ma'adi champions he sought fresh victims in
Cairo. The Scotch engineer on the transport
was a fine player, but he couldn't checkmate the
padre.</p>

<p>When we landed in Gallipoli the first thing the
padre did was to dig a dug-out. The second was
to seek a chess-mate. There was no chessboard,
so he got the lid of a box. There were no
chessmen, so he carved Queens and Bishops and
Knights and Pawns out of the flotsam and jetsam
on Anzac Beach. Then, safely ensconced in a
snug little dug-out, the padre and his mate stalemated
and checkmated to their hearts' content,
oblivious of the shells which burst around. Immediately
after his tour of the trenches, and his
visit to the sick, the padre would make for his
chess-mate.</p>

<p>Later on we found him making periodical visits
to the hospital ship. I admit he religiously did
the rounds of the wards, and looked after the
wounded, and I frankly admit that I went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
board to see the nurses, but I'm positive the
driving force behind the padre's visits was the
prospect of a game of chess with the skipper.</p>

<p>After a few months on Gallipoli the Padre was
transferred to the hospital at Lemnos. We all
sympathized with him, stuck at the base, and
missing all the fun of the fighting. Then we
heard that the M.O. at the hospital was a great
chess-player, and we knew that the Padre never
deserved our sympathy.</p>

GOOD "BAG"&mdash;A WAR OF TROGLODYTES&mdash;BEATING
THE TURK AT HIS OWN
GAME</p></div>


<p class="mt2">They are not battles or fights; they are
hardly skirmishes even. They are just
"stunts."</p>

<p>I don't like the word "stunt"; it sounds like
an American vaudeville turn. But somehow it
attained a general vogue on Gallipoli, and it
meant any of the little incidents, episodes, and
brushes with the enemy which served to relieve
the monotony of trench warfare.</p>

<p>Having been ousted from their "impregnable"
positions on the coast, the Turks dug in deep to
block the advance of the Australians on the west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
and the Allies on the south. Slowly they were
being shifted; more by the pick and shovel than
the rifle. The trenches were only a few yards
apart in some places; several hundred yards
apart in others. And it was in the neutral zone
between the hostile armies that these "stunts"
took place.</p>

<p>Mostly they were planned and executed under
cover of darkness, for a head couldn't be shown
above the trenches in daylight without getting a
score of bullets. Our chaps were far more enterprising
and venturesome than the Turks, but the
latter were better patrols. The reason was that
the Turks know the country, wear a kind of
moccasin on their feet, and move about quite
noiselessly. With our heavy service-boots silence
is impossible. So we got out early&mdash;just after
dark&mdash;waited in ambush, and caught Tommy
Turk when he came poking his nose into our
business.</p>

<p>One fine "stunt" was spoilt by a cough.
Lieutenant Chatham, of the 5th Light Horse,
had a troop out in ambush near the Balkan gun
pits, where the Turks were working each night.
Just when the enemy's patrol approached, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of our troopers felt a tickling in the throat. He
tried to swallow the tickle and couldn't. He
gulped, but the tickling continued aggravating.
At last he stuffed his handkerchief in his mouth
and coughed. It was only an insignificant little
cough; but it sufficed. The Turkish patrol
halted and the leader investigated. Stealthily
he crept up till he could almost touch the crouching
Australian. Bang! Finish Turk. Patrol
"imshi." That was one to us. But for the
unfortunate cough we might have got half a
dozen.</p>

<p>The enemy scored next time. One of their
snipers, over-bold, crept up in the scrub to within
twenty yards of the trenches of the 7th Light
Horse, and started blazing away. Our fellows
could not get him from the trenches, so Sergeant
Ducker and three others volunteered to rush
the Turk's "posey" and bring him in, dead or
alive. Cautiously they fixed bayonets, climbed
on to the parapet, and then dashed out. They
found the sniper's nest, but the bird had flown.
A number of empty cartridge cases bore testimony
to his activity. But the scrub was full of
snipers, and as our dashing quartette dashed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
home a hot fusillade was opened on them from
the Turkish trenches and the scrub. Ducker
dashed into shelter so fast that he landed on
General Ryrie's back. No. 2 sent a miniature
avalanche of dust and débris on top of Colonel
Cox; No. 3 landed on my pet corn; and No. 4,
Trooper Edgeworth, got a Turkish bullet in the
arm. "Maleesch."</p>

<p>One of our best exploits was "White's one-night
stunt," as it was called. The General
wanted a certain position taken and occupied.
Our brigade had to do it. Under cover of night
a patrol went out, reconnoitred the position, and
formed a covering party for the work to come.
Major Fred. White then took 150 men of the 6th
Light Horse, armed with picks and shovels as
well as their rifles, and dug a long sap six feet
deep, right out to Harris Ridge. Then the
trenches were dug, and the position occupied.
The Sixth dug like miners, and burrowed like
rabbits. Next morning when Abdul awoke he
beheld the smoke of the Light Horse camp fires
and the hill in possession of the enemy. And
the Turks wondered what had happened.</p>

<p>One morning early, Major Windeyer, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
7th, poked his head over the parapet to enjoy
the panorama, and a Turkish sniper let fly, the
bullet just whizzing past his ear. Several
snipers had been heard in front of our lines, but
not located. So it was decided to drive them off.
Fifty volunteered for the job; six were chosen,
but it was found that a dozen joined in the rush.
The Turkish patrol was easily driven back by
Sergeant Walker and his comrades, and the
Turks in the foremost trench were so surprised that
about fifty rounds were poured into them before
they got busy. At least one was killed before
their reinforcements came tumbling up. Then
the Australians bolted for home, and reached
safety without any casualties, though the Turks
blazed away like fury. That's the luck of the
game.</p>

<p>Sergeant Brennan, who used to be in the
Dublin Fusiliers, and whose camp kitchens at
Liverpool have often been admired by Sydney
visitors, was in charge of the cooks and dixies of
the 7th Light Horse. Every morning, breakfast
over, he took down his rifle, strolled across to
the trenches, and had innumerable duels with
Turkish snipers. He had the range of all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
trenches, and when he saw a sniper's "posey"
he blazed away till he silenced the enemy. Now
and then an unwary Turk showed half a head,
and this Irish sharpshooter was on to him like a
shot. Some days he would come back to camp
angry and disappointed. "Thirty shots and not a
single scalp," he exclaimed, kicking aside some
innocent mess tin. But at other times he stalked
back as if he had won the battle of Anzac "on his
own." "Killed three Turkeys," he cried. And
then he was as happy as Larry all day.</p>

<p>But there was one man in the 5th Light Horse
Regiment whom we called "The Murderer." He
played the Turks at their own game, and beat them
badly. He himself admitted it was "a shame to
take the money." He used to sit with his rifle set
at a certain track which the enemy thought was
well concealed behind the hills. His mate had a
telescope, and spotted for him. They waited till
they saw a head appear, and they knew that
three seconds later a Turk would be in full view
for two seconds. That was quite enough. "The
Murderer" was ready. The spotter said
"Right"; the rifle fired, and another victim of
German "kultur" fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>The man's name was Billy Sing, a Queenslander,
belonging to "Midgley's Myrmidons."
The 5th Light Horse Regiment was nominally
composed of Queenslanders; but the North
Coast rivers of New South Wales were included
in the 1st Commonwealth Military District. A
great many men from the Tweed, Richmond,
and Clarence Rivers enlisted in Brisbane. This
was particularly true of the 5th Light Horse, for
the majority of Major Midgley's squadron hailed
from Northern New South Wales. They revelled
in the exploits of the gallant little Major, swearing
to follow him anywhere, so we called them
Midgley's Myrmidons. If he were casually to
remark, "Come on, boys, I think we'll take Achi
Baba to-night," not one of them would have
hesitated an instant. Major Midgley reckoned
that since the glorious game of War degenerated
into a battle of troglodytes, we might as well make
it interesting and diverting. So, in this particular
section of our line of battle, things were
always happening. We never wanted for diversion.
But this same diversion was always at the
expense of our friend the enemy, and poor Abdul
was correspondingly angry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>Sing held the Australian snipers' record. He
was a crack shot, and had often won prizes at
Brisbane and Randwick. Day after day, night
after night, he used to settle down comfortably
in his "posey" and wait for his prey. His
patience was inexhaustible. He would sit for
hours on end with a telescope glued to his eye,
watching the tracks or trenches, where sooner
or later a Turk was sure to show himself. If a
Turk looked up, and then bobbed down quickly,
Sing only grinned and waited. He would get
his Turk later on. Emboldened by fancied
immunity, the unsuspecting one would show his
head again, then his shoulders, then half his body.
Then Sing's rifle would crack, and another notch
be made in the stick. There was not the slightest
doubt of his performances, for every day an
officer or non-commissioned officer checked the
shot and recorded the kill. Before he left Anzac
Billy Sing bagged over 150 Turks.</p>

<p>One night he went with the rest of Midgley's
Myrmidons on a rather hazardous enterprise.
It turned out to be one of the most successful
affairs undertaken. General Ryrie wanted to
know how strongly held were the Turkish trenches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
on an imposing ridge opposite our lines. The
5th Light Horse Regiment (Major Wilson) had to
find out. Major Midgley's squadron had to make
the attack. Major Johnson's squadron skirted
the coast to keep Gaba Tepe quiet and guard
against a flank attack. Captain Pike's squadron
manned our outpost, and brought covering fire
to bear on the enemy's right. One of our destroyers
fired a few salvos at the Turks' position;
just something to go on with. Then the Myrmidons
sneaked out. It was about four o'clock in
the morning. The moon had just set. Through
the scrub they crept silently and stealthily. Not
a sound escaped them till they were within thirty
yards of the enemy's trenches. Then something
warned a sentry, and he fired half a dozen shots
into the scrub. But our lads lay low and made
no sound, and the sentry evidently thought he
was mistaken.</p>

<p>At a word from the Major the line started
slowly forward again, and, unnoticed, reached a
little knoll, not ten yards from the Turkish
trenches. Then the music began, with a pyrotechnic
display thrown in. Our "grenadiers"
threw bombs and grenades thick and fast on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
bewildered garrison, while on either wing our
riflemen blazed away, driving back the supports
which hurried up from the enemy's rear. On the
shore line, B Squadron opened on the Gaba Tepe
defences, while we in the trenches blazed away
at Pine Ridge till our rifles burned our hands.
The silence of the night was broken by a fierce
fusillade, as pin-points of fire burst from the
whole length of the Turkish trenches. But the
regiments on our left lay low in their trenches,
and laughed at the Turks' impotent rage. We
on the post had one man very slightly wounded&mdash;just
a scratch. The shore line squadron had also
one man wounded&mdash;rather badly.</p>

<p>Midgley's gallant Myrmidons effected a splendid
withdrawal, for after they had cleaned out the
Turks' advance trench they came back to our
lines with only one man wounded in the leg.
When he came in Major Midgley reported to the
General: "We've got 'em stone cold. My birds
simply bombed them out, cleaned out the trench,
bagged about thirty, and are now back for breakfast."</p>

<p class="mt2">August on Gallipoli will be long remembered
by the Australian troops on account
of the terrific fighting in which they participated.
July was fairly quiet. But August witnessed the
great flanking movement of the British troops,
which we were confident at the time would result
in the final defeat of the Turks on the Peninsula.</p>

<p>The new movement took the form of an attack
and demonstration in front, while under cover
of darkness a new British force landed at Suvla
Bay and enveloped the enemy's flank. In the
better understood parlance of the ring, we feinted
with our right, and landed a terrific blow with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
our left. So successful was this feint that all the
local reserves of the Turks were hurried up to
counter it, thus leaving an opening for the main
attack from Suvla.</p>

<p>All the honour and glory of the magnificent
charge of our Australians and the capture of Lone
Pine Ridge belongs to our infantry comrades
of the 1st Brigade. We of the Light Horse can
claim none of the kudos for that gallant feat of
arms, though the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and 2nd
Infantry Brigade fought like tigers day after day
and night after night to hold the line during the
consequent counter-attacks.</p>

<p>There was some fierce and bloody fighting
during those early days of August all along the
line, but the capture of Lone Pine Ridge stands
out, not only because of the complete success of the
operation but on account of the irresistible dash
and daring of the lads from New South Wales.</p>

<p>Just before the battle we got a message from
Sir Ian Hamilton. It was in a Special Order
issued from the general headquarters of the
Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, and was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p class="right">"IAN HAMILTON, General."</p></div>

<p class="mt2">For five days and nights the battle raged on
Gallipoli. The cannon roared incessantly; big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
guns, little guns, field guns, mortars, ships' guns,
and howitzers belching forth their iron hail till
the earth trembled again.</p>

<p>Hardly heard amid the thunderous roar of
artillery were the interminable rattle of musketry,
and the spiteful snapping of Maxims.
From the firing fine to the base, hardly a square
foot of ground seemed safe from shrapnel shells
and high explosives. Probably 200,000 men
were engaged, hacking at each other day and
night; for this seemed the decisive battle of the
Gallipoli campaign.</p>

<p>It made one's blood flow faster and tingle with
pride to see the magnificent way our young Australians
played the great game of war. Hemmed
in and cooped up in the trenches for weary weeks,
they had at last been let loose upon the enemy
at Lone Pine. Like hounds from the leash, they
charged across the bullet-swept area between
the contending armies. The Turkish lines spat
fire from every loophole, and machine-guns
seemed to revel in murderous music. On swept
the line, thinned but dauntless. Heroes fell on
every side. Enfilading volleys swept across
from the side. To us on the right the men seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
to falter for a space; but it was only to hack
their way through the maze of barbed wire.
Then they scrambled over the sandbags, their
last obstacle, and bayoneted the Turks by scores.
One wild mêlée on the parapet&mdash;thrust, lunge,
and parry&mdash;then the trenches were ours.</p>

<p>This charge was only one little episode in the
long, long struggle of those early days of August.
Each time the Turks massed for a charge Colonel
Rosenthal's guns tore great rents in their ranks,
and wrought havoc in their trenches. But again
and again their bomb-throwers&mdash;hidden behind
the communication trenches&mdash;massed and endeavoured
to retake the position.</p>

<p>On the left the Australian and New Zealand
Division, with whom were our 3rd Light Horse
Brigade, made a splendid advance over shrapnel-swept
ravines, defended by trenches and machine-guns
cunningly hidden in the scrub. They
charged the heights like the Highlanders at Darghai,
but against a far more formidable foe. They
suffered terribly, especially the Light Horsemen,
but there was no stopping them.</p>

<p>Hundreds of prisoners were captured, much
ammunition, many rifles, and a few machine-guns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
The prisoners stated that the Australians'
attack was a complete surprise. But a far
greater surprise awaited them. At night in the
offing there was only seen one hospital ship,
though now and then a destroyer sent its searchlight
on to the hills. But when the first streaks
of dawn-light fell on the Ægean Sea the amazed
Turks beheld a vast flotilla, and in futile anger
the German staff officers witnessed another landing
on Gallipoli. Almost unmolested, a new
British force landed at Suvla Bay, for the Turks
had hurried all their reinforcements back to stem
the onrush of the Australasians. Several warships
and a score of destroyers glided into the bay
or round the projecting horns, and sent a veritable
tornado of shells on to the enemy's position.</p>

<p>A dozen big transports came up and emptied
their khaki freight into a hundred barges, pinnaces,
launches, and sweepers. The new force
landed, formed up, and marched inland against
the Turkish right. At first the resistance was
feeble, and the enemy was driven back beyond
the salt lake towards the hills. More troops were
hurried up from Gallipoli, and the fight waxed
more strenuous. Nothing in the war has provoked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
so much keen disappointment and vitriolic
criticism as the Suvla Bay business. We who
saw the landing, mingled with the British troops
and knew how much depended on the success of
the venture, are perhaps not the best critics.
We do not know all the facts of the case. We
think Sir Ian Hamilton's strategy was brilliant.
We know the work of the Navy was magnificent.
We fear that after the landing, the attack was
not pushed home with that vigour and determination
which were essential for the success of
the operation. Precious time was lost, and
while the British hesitated the Turks hurried
up reinforcements and once more barred the way
to Constantinople. And we had hoped that
August would herald the beginning of the end.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The First Infantry Brigade of the Australian
Division did big things since landing on Gallipoli&mdash;glorious
deeds that will be the pride and boast
of successive generations of Australians. It was
Colonel Maclagan's 3rd Brigade that achieved
undying fame by the electric daring of its picturesque
landing, but it was the 1st Brigade which,
following hot on the heels of the gallant Thirds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
on that memorable day, swarmed up the heights
and drove back at the point of the bayonet the
successive swarms of fanatical Turks who tried
in vain to drive them into the sea. But how
dearly was that victory won! How the ranks
of these gallant Sydneysiders were decimated!
It was small comfort to us to know that Constantinople
reported 120,000 Turkish casualties for
the three months after our landing.</p>

<p>The list of senior officers killed was appalling;
not one of the original battalion commanders
retained his command. Not less tragic was the
loss of junior officers. In the Lone Pine attack
the 3rd Battalion lost eight officers killed and
nine wounded; while the 2nd Battalion lost
nine killed and eight wounded. We captured
many prisoners, several machine-guns, and many
thousands of rounds of ammunition. But the
cost to young Australia was so heavy!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lone Pine Ridge was situated right in front
of the centre of the Australians' position, and
was strongly held and fortified like a little Gibraltar.
The overhead cover was so strong that
our shells made little impression on the Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
trenches. Machine-guns punctuated the line at
regular intervals. The open space in front was
swept by enfilading fire from the Bloody Angle
on the left and the Pine Ridge on the right, while
the German gunners behind Gun Ridge had the
range to a nicety. A network of barbed wire
entanglements provided a nasty obstacle right in
front of their trenches, while "posies" for expert
snipers and bomb-throwers completed their
defence works. To the trained soldier the position
looked absolutely impregnable.</p>

<p>But our lads were well trained. They reckoned
they were veterans. I who had visited
them in camp and on the march round about
Liverpool knew the stuff of which they were made.
Yet there were those who, ere they left Sydney,
said the Australians would only do garrison duty,
as it would be murder to put them in the firing
line. Competent critics held that General Birdwood
was the luckiest man in the army in getting
the command of the Australians, for no troops in
the world could do what they have done. Is
this boasting? Ask the British staff officers.
Ask the French. Ask the Gurkhas and the other
Indian soldiers.</p>

  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>
<p class="mt2">The First Infantry Brigade fired not a single
shot during the great charge. It was all bayonet
work. In the ranks were many of the heroes
who landed on the memorable 25th of April, were
wounded, and were now back in the firing line.
Others had been in the thick of it all the time;
no periodical spells such as the soldiers in Flanders
get. Others again were the latest reinforcements
who left Sydney in June, and landed the
evening before the battle. Yet these raw youngsters,
having their first experience under fire,
charged with the best, and wielded a bloody
bayonet within the hour. And many of them&mdash;Dr.
Digges la Touche amongst the number&mdash;perished
in their first fight.</p>

<p>Prior to the charge our artillery opened a heavy
bombardment of the Lone Pine trenches. Shrapnel
and high explosives rained down on the
Turkish lines. The Turkish gunners in turn
opened on our lines a devastating fire, and the
resultant roar of heavy guns and screeching of
shells created a veritable inferno.</p>

<p>I don't know how long it lasted, but suddenly
our guns ceased, and on the instant our gallant
infantry sprang from their trenches and charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
straight ahead. They were over our parapets
and well on their way before the Turks could
realize it. Then rifles and machine-guns started
a murderous fusillade, while the guns in the background
sent a hail of shrapnel. Thick and fast
fell the attackers. One marvels how any escaped
that hell of fire. But, fortunately, only a small
percentage of the Turks are marksmen. The
German machine-gunners, however, were very
deadly, and the enfilading fire from Pine Ridge
increased in volume and effectiveness and the
trail to Lonesome Pine was strewn with khaki
figures. Our Light Horse on the right had all
their crack shots picking off the Turks on Pine
Ridge, while our field guns in Hughes's battery
at point-blank range helped to keep the enfilading
fire from this quarter down to a minimum.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Firsts had almost reached their
goal. They were checked for a space by the
barbed wire; but hacking their way through
they scaled the enemy's parapets, tore aside the
overhead cover, leaped into the trenches, and
then, free from the murderous cross-fire of
machine-guns, they resolutely set to work with
the bayonet to finish the job. Since the days of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
Plevna the Turk has been reckoned second to no
soldiers in the world behind the trenches and
parapets. I am not in a position to dispute this,
but I do claim that in the open or with the
bayonet the Turk is not a match for the Australians.
Right along the trenches and saps the
Firsts fought their way, bayoneting every Turk
or German who did not immediately throw
down his rifle. Here and there the defenders
made some resistance, and little knots of them
would rally for a minute or two. But the Firsts
flew at them like eagle-hawks, and a neat bit of
bayonet work settled the Turks for good and all.</p>

<p>As to the part played by the Light Horse
Brigades in the general scheme of attack, it fell
to General Ryrie's Second Brigade to hold the
right of the line opposite Gaba Tepe. We made
minor demonstrations against the enemy, cleaned
out a few of his trenches, kept his snipers very
much in subjection, mined and counter-mined,
and blew up Abdul's tunnel just when he thought
he was going to do the same to us. Also, we
kept each day a fresh squadron in Lonesome
Pine to assist in defending against the Turkish
counter-attacks. Our losses had not been great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
considering the slaughter all along the line. Since
landing we had had just over 600 casualties, of
whom 105 were killed; also we had had several
hundred sent sick to hospital.</p>

<p>General Chauvel's First Brigade had suffered
much more heavily. They had well performed
their share of the trench fighting since May. In
the big battle the First Regiment had to advance
under a murderous fire from Pope's Hill, and
take the Turkish trenches opposite the Bloody
Angle. Captain Laurie, with A Squadron, scaled
the parapets and charged across the bullet-swept
interval, while Captain Cox, with B Squadron,
crawled up a gully; and then both squadrons
rushed to the attack.</p>

<p>Without firing a shot, they captured three
successive trenches, bayoneting the defenders,
and then swept on. Twelve officers and 200
troopers made that dashing charge, and without
reinforcements they withstood all the Turkish
counter-attacks from four o'clock in the afternoon
till half-past six. But the slaughter was cruel.
Fewer and fewer were left to defend the hard-won
trenches. From all sides the enemy threw
bombs and grenades. Our bombs were all gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
At last the remnant had to retire. Major Reid
was killed; Captain Cox so badly wounded that
he died a few days later; only fifty unwounded
men regained our trenches. Of all the officers,
Major Glasgow alone was unwounded.</p>

<p>A worse fate befel the 3rd Brigade, under
General Hughes. In their attack on Walker's
Ridge they lost thirty-two officers and 400 men
in ten minutes. They swarmed out of our
trenches and sprang forward; and then so
terrific was the hail of bullets that they fell in
heaps. It almost looked as if they had thrown
themselves prone to get cover. Machine-guns
swept the area from end to end. The 8th (Victorian)
and 10th (Western Australian) Light
Horse Regiments just thinned out and wilted
away. About a hundred unwounded men came
back from that hell.</p>

<p>Later on the 3rd Brigade had their revenge.
When the New Zealand and Australian Division
swept forward, driving the enemy before them,
and capturing trench after trench, there remained
one spot on the line of ridges that baffled the
attack. Both sides dug in, and had a few days'
respite. Then the 10th Light Horse hurled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
themselves on the stubborn Turks, cleaned out
their trenches, and with bloody bayonets stood
masters of the hill. It was only a remnant of
the regiment that remained, but they baffled every
effort of the Turks to dislodge them.</p>

<p>One spot further along the line had at length
given way to the pressure of the enemy's attacks.
The New Zealanders, after some magnificent
fighting for several days, had been driven back
from one point on the line. It was essential
that the position should be retaken and our
advanced line linked up. So the 9th Light Horse
Regiment was sent forward to do the job, and
they did it brilliantly....</p>

<p>The pen seems so futile a thing to depict the
scene. It was the same thing day after day. A
stealthy advance through the scrub, a rattle of
snipers' rifles, then wild cheers, as the Australians
scrambled up the hill; a terrific fusillade as they
neared their objective; a glint of gleaming bayonets
as they charged the trenches; then the
wild mêlée of hand-to-hand fighting, when one
Australian always reckons himself a match for
three Turks; and finally the shout of victory.</p>

<p>And through it all the stretcher-bearers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
real true-blue. Under the heaviest fire they
went right up to the firing-line, tended the
wounded, and carried them back to the field
hospitals. Oh, you, who think the Army Medical
Corps is always comfortably and safely situated
at the base, pray be undeceived! Their part is
just as hazardous as that of the soldier of the line.</p>

<p>Soon the cheers of the victors and the cries of the
Turks died down. Above the groans of the wounded
could be heard the staccato tones of the officers
ordering platoons and sections this way and that
to defend the position against counter-attacks.</p>

<p>Scores of prisoners were led away. Hundreds
of captured rifles were stacked. German machine-guns
were faced about and manned. Bomb-throwers
were placed in position. Hot tea was
served out to the men. Night fell. Lone Pine
was ours. The successive ridges on our left
towards Hill 971 had all been captured by the
New Zealanders, and our 4th Infantry Brigade
under General Monash and the 3rd Light Horse
Brigade under General Hughes. The big battle of
Suvla Bay was over. But it was only a partial
victory. Despite our gains and our losses the
Turks still blocked the way to Constantinople.</p>

AND DISENTOMBED</p></div>


<p class="mt2">When I was a good little boy going to
Sunday school, teacher gave me a book
entitled <cite>Wonderful Escapes</cite>. I read it with
absorbing interest, for it told of the marvellous
escapes of princes and princesses from fortified
castles in the hands of their enemies.</p>

<p>Yet these delightful tales which so thrilled my
youthful imagination pale into insignificance and
seem quite commonplace when compared with
the hair-breadth escapes which I have witnessed,
and which I have myself experienced since the
2nd Light Horse Brigade landed on battle-scarred
Gallipoli.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>With the Taubes dropping bombs and darts
from the sky, with the Turks undermining and
blowing up our advanced trenches, with snipers
cunningly concealed on the ridges, and the
enemy's big guns sending high explosives right
across the Peninsula, there is really not a single
safe spot in all Gallipoli. So, when these Australian
soldiers get home again and fight their
battles o'er again, don't disbelieve them. The
truth here is much more startling than any fiction.</p>

<p>I vouch for the absolute accuracy of the following
incidents, for they all came within my own ken.
Some will say 'tis "luck"; some, "fate." Others
speak of the law of averages. It may be that
the prayers of thousands of Australian mothers
and sisters beseeching Heaven for the safety of
their loved ones are not all in vain. For in very
truth there have been occasions when escape
from instant death has savoured of the supernatural.
Men have left their dug-outs for a few
seconds, and almost on the instant a shell has
wrecked those same dug-outs. Others have
seen shells fall on the identical spot they occupied
a few seconds before. Men have come back
scatheless from the open field which has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
ploughed with shrapnel. Some have charged
across the hills in the teeth of murderous machine-guns,
which were spitting death-pellets unceasingly.</p>

<p>General Birdwood was having a look at the
enemy's position when a sniper's bullet parted
his hair and split his scalp. Half an inch lower
would have been certain death. It would take
pages and pages to tell of the lucky escapes I
could relate.</p>

<p>Take the case of Colonel Ryrie, now a brigadier-general.
There is a very comforting idea that
regimental headquarters are always a long way
behind the firing-line, while brigade headquarters
are further back still. Therefore, it is
argued, a brigadier has a nice, safe job. This
may be all right in theory, but it does not work
out so in practice. I call to mind that hearty
send-off given to the then Colonel Ryrie by his
constituents at North Sydney, and what the
recipient of that favour said on the occasion.
"Don't you worry about me," he said, "I'll
come back all right. They may knock some
corners off me, but they won't get me." Some
"corners" have been knocked off him. I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
believe there has been a day when the Brigadier-General
has not visited the firing-line of his
brigade&mdash;up to the time when a bullet got him
in the neck and he was lost to us for some time
in hospital. Time and again he has taken the
sniper's "posey" and mingled in a bit of sharpshooting
himself. Also, he has at different times
gone in advance of our firing-line to select new
positions. Once, with his brigade-major and
orderly officer, he suddenly stopped to watch a
squadron at bayonet exercise, and a shrapnel
shell burst, and the case landed right in front of
him. Had he not stopped, it is certain the
party would have been wiped out.</p>

<p>On another occasion the Brigadier-General and
Major Onslow, Major Suttor, Major Windeyer,
Major Rutledge, Captain Miller and Captain
Higgins were outside Colonel Arnott's dug-out,
when three shells burst overhead. No one was
hurt, though a fragment of shell landed in the
midst of them. There is always so much more
landscape to hit than man.</p>

<p>Such incidents can be multiplied by the score.
Sergeant Christie Hayden&mdash;who was badly
wounded in South Africa&mdash;emerged from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
dug-out the other day, and a shell missed him by
inches, and wrecked his little grey home. Sergeant
Paddy Ryan, Sergeant Ken Alford, and
Lieutenant Pearce were standing together on
Holly Ridge a few days ago and a sniper's bullet
perforated the hats of both the sergeants, and
missed the officer by a fraction of an inch. I
wonder did that sniper wait till he got the three
in line, instead of making sure of one? Trooper
Sandy Jacques showed his head over a parapet
for a couple of seconds, and a sniper fired, but by
a merciful dispensation of Providence, the bullet
split just before reaching him. The nickel casing
went to the right, and the leaden missile to the
left. So Jacques got a slight wound on each
side of the head, and was able to walk to the
ambulance. Some wag has suggested that the
bullet knew very well what to expect if it struck
Sandy's head, so it took the line of least resistance;
another said that Jacques was wounded by
two different bullets from a machine-gun. Lieutenant
Lang sent a man for water. As he walked
away a high explosive shell passed right between
his legs and then exploded. The soldier merely
exclaimed "Strewth!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>Here's an example of good and bad luck following
one upon the other's heels. The Turks bombarded
our lines, and hurled half a dozen shells
into our trench, smashing down parapets, wrecking
rifles and gear, splathering bullets and
splinters everywhere, and yet miraculously missing
everybody. Later on a single stray bullet
found its way through a loophole, ran off at an
eccentric angle, and killed young Trooper Bellinger,
one of the best lads in the Sixth.</p>

<p>I went down to Anzac Cove for a swim. About
500 soldiers were having a glorious time&mdash;better
than Bondi. Half a dozen shells landed in the
water, while the pellets splashed all round like hail.
Most of the swimmers sought shelter; some took
not the slightest notice. Not one man was hit!
But they are not always as lucky as that. Sometimes
they pay for their temerity. Trumpeter
Newman and I stood outside the field hospital a
week ago, and a big howitzer shell burst fairly in
front of us, killing or wounding a dozen men.
Neither of us suffered a scratch, but there was a
ringing in my ears for hours afterwards.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Ferguson was out on Ryrie's Post,
beyond the firing-line, for over an hour, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Turkish artillery just dotted the whole area with
shrapnel. Hardly a square yard missed getting
something, yet he never stopped one. When
Sergeant Shelley walked along Shell Green a shell
burst, and we could hardly see him for the dust
kicked up by the flying shrapnel bullets, yet he
never got a scratch. Another shell just shaved
an infantryman, who turned round, shook his
fist at it, and swore loud and long. A second
shell came after the first, so close that it almost
took the soldier's breath away. He did not wait
to swear again, but ran like a scared rabbit to his
dug-out!</p>

<p>An infantry officer vouched for the accuracy
of the following story:&mdash;Two "Jack Johnson"
shells (probably fired from the <i>Goeben</i>) landed in
quick succession in a trench occupied by half-a-dozen
Australians. The first tore down the
parapet and buried one of the soldiers. Before
his mates could dig him out the second shell
burst in and disentombed him.</p>

<p>DEATH OF DIGGES LA TOUCHE&mdash;A GREAT SPIRITUAL
LOSS&mdash;THE CROSS AND THE CRESCENT&mdash;A
SPLENDID RECORD&mdash;ANDREW GILLISON'S
DEATH&mdash;A GALLANT CHRISTIAN SOLDIER&mdash;DUTY'S
SACRIFICE</p></div>


<p class="mt2">La Touche is dead....</p>

<p>Digges La Touche, the brilliant scholar,
the fervid evangelist, the militant divine, the
fiery orator, the pugnacious debater, the uncompromising
Unionist, the electric Irishman&mdash;Digges
La Touche, the patriot, is dead: killed in his first
battle, yea, in the first minute of his first battle.</p>

<p>It came as a shock to those of us who knew
him in camp. It will come as a bigger shock to
those who knew him in the Church, for it seems
scarcely more than a month since they bade him
God-speed in Sydney. He landed in Gallipoli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
on August 5, the eve of the big battle. That
night he went into the trenches. Next day he
participated in the gallant charge of the First
Brigade which found its culmination in the capture
of Lone Pine Ridge. But La Touche never
reached the Turkish trenches. Charging at the
head of his platoon, he had barely got beyond
our own trenches when a bullet struck him in the
body. He fell. Later he managed to crawl back
to our trenches&mdash;and died.</p>

<p>For ten months he had pleaded with Church
and State to let him serve as a soldier of the king.
For ten weeks he wore the uniform of an officer
of the Australian Imperial Force. For ten hours
he did duty in the trenches. For ten brief seconds
he knew the wild exultation of the charge.
Then there passed away a great-hearted Britisher,
strong of soul and clear of vision, who counted it
a great privilege to fight and die for his king
and country. The Crescent had glorified the
Cross.</p>

<p>The pity of it all was that none of his friends
knew he had arrived. The Dean of Sydney&mdash;Chaplain-Colonel
Talbot&mdash;was about to read the
burial service over eighteen soldiers who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
perished in the charge. He heard the name,
and looked and saw his friend. That was the
first he knew of Lieutenant La Touche's arrival
on Gallipoli&mdash;his arrival and departure.</p>

<p>When we of the Sixth Light Horse first went
into camp at Rosebery Park, La Touche was there
with the Thirteenth Battalion, under Colonel
Burnage, one of the most popular, as he afterwards
proved one of the most gallant, officers
who ever donned a uniform. Dr. Digges La
Touche desired first to go as a chaplain, but was
not selected. Far be it from me to reflect on the
judgment of the Archbishop of Perth who
selected the Anglican chaplains, but I have seen
chaplains with not one tithe of the qualifications
that La Touche had for the job. Failing selection
as a chaplain, he enlisted as a private in the
First Contingent. But he was not over-robust
and was transferred to the Second Contingent,
and rose to be a colour-sergeant in the Thirteenth.
The Primate objected to ministers serving as
soldiers, and the friends of Digges La Touche
time and again urged him to remain behind.
But his determination was fixed, and though
health considerations compelled his withdrawal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
from the Thirteenth Battalion he attended an
officers' training school and gained a commission
as second lieutenant; and he left Sydney in
June with the Sixth Reinforcements of the
Second Battalion. Then, after a brief spell in
Egypt, he came to Gallipoli.</p>

<p>Before he got his commission La Touche was a
great recruiting sergeant. He never left in the
minds of his hearers any doubts as to his opinion
of Prussian militarism and savagery. His addresses
on the war were fiery orations, inspiring
men to patriotic self-sacrifice and zeal for Empire.
He summoned all the riches of his intellect to
confound, refute and castigate the nation that
had done such scathe to Belgium. And though
no Turk or Hun died by his hand, Dr. La
Touche inspired many young Australians to take
their place in the firing-line. Some of these were
with him in the fatal charge. He saw them dash
on through the bursting shrapnel, and he heard
the cheers of victory as they gained the parapets,
bayoneted the defenders and captured the position.
As one thinks of him cut off in the prime
of life, when the unbalanced enthusiasm of his
youth had hardly been tempered by experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
there comes a feeling of revolt against the decrees
of the God of Battles.</p>

<p>But Everard Digges La Touche was only one of
the many brilliant young men who have laid down
their lives in this cruel war. Remembering the
inspiration of his example, one feels that he did
not die in vain.</p>

<p>Others will speak of his scholarship&mdash;he was
a student in law, arts and theology, and a lecturer
of Trinity College, Dublin, before he went to
Australia. I have seen him in the pulpit, in
Synod and on the public platform, but I leave it
to others to appraise his churchmanship. I
merely record, with heartfelt sorrow, how Lieutenant
La Touche died a soldier's death on
Gallipoli.</p>

<p>The Church Militant! Was it ever so militant
as now, when all the powers of darkness, all the
forces of the Devil, are arrayed against Christianity
and all the manifold blessings of Civilization?
Look at stricken Belgium and the battlefields of
France, where hundreds of priests combine their
holy offices as chaplains with the duties of the
soldier, a Bible in one hand, a sword in the other!
See, at the head of Russian armies, priests leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the soldiers into battle! And here, on Gallipoli ...</p>

<p>We have our chaplains, and we have ministers
of the Gospel fighting as "happy warriors" in
the ranks. Digges La Touche had the character
of the happy warrior, who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While the mortal mist is gathering, draws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His breath in confidence of Heaven's applause.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But it matters little whether they go forth as
armed men in the Great Crusade, or to fight the
good fight by ministering to the dying, or to read
the burial service over the dead, they all must
needs be brave men, ready to risk their lives.
Death is very close to all of us in this war&mdash;chaplains,
doctors, stretcher-bearers and all.</p>

<p>Brave men, yes. Fighting parsons, soldier
saints, whether they be chaplains, or whether
they have forsaken the study for the stricken field,
the pulpit for the platoon, or whether they be in
the Army Medical Corps, heroes of the Red Cross
of Geneva. Some have been killed, some wounded.</p>

<p>Andrew Gillison is one of those who has gone
to his rest&mdash;one of Gallipoli's heroes. Chaplain-Captain
Andrew Gillison, of the Fourteenth
Battalion, Fourth Infantry Brigade, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
first of the Australian army chaplains to be killed.
Prior to the war&mdash;and that seems a long, long
time ago&mdash;he was a minister of St. George's
Presbyterian Church, East St. Kilda, and before
that he was at St. Paul's, Brisbane. He was
well known and greatly loved throughout the
whole Presbyterian Church of Australia. He
was no sour-visaged, long-faced Christian. His
religion was cheerful, optimistic and joyous.
I met him at St. Andrew's, Cairo, and then I
knew why the Fourth Brigade almost worshipped
him. On the transport he was a prime favourite.
He sang a good comic song. He entered into the
boxing tournament. He won his first bout in
fine style. Then he got a hiding, and took his
beating like a man.</p>

<p>It was meet that such a man should die giving
his life for another. Greater love hath no man
than this; and Andrew Gillison would not have
willed it otherwise. It was while performing a
work of necessity and mercy on Sunday morning,
August 22, that he was shot, and he died a few
hours afterwards.</p>

<p>The New Zealand and Australian Division had
made a most gallant attack on the hills occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
by the Turks. Pressing home the attack with the
bayonet, they drove the enemy from trench to
trench and from ridge to ridge. Deeds of valour
were performed day after day and night after
night. Heroes died on every side, with no historian
to tell how gallantly they died. One of
these young Australians was wounded in the
charge, and lay some distance behind the advanced
position. It was then that two fighting
parsons came along a communication trench,
which was comparatively safe from rifle fire, but
offered little protection from shrapnel. From
a slight hollow they saw the wounded man, in
evident agony, raise his hand, and try to move.
Captain Gillison and Corporal Pittenrigh&mdash;who
is a Methodist minister when not a soldier&mdash;decided
to try to effect a rescue, though they
knew a machine-gun was trained on the trench,
and had been warned to beware of snipers.
Mounting the parapet, they crawled along some
distance towards the wounded man. A couple
of bullets zipped by, but they pushed on. More
bullets flew, and both the rescuers were wounded.</p>

<p>Then they tried to regain the shelter of the
trench, and Gillison was wounded again, but his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
companion managed to scramble in. Mortally
wounded in the chest and the side, the poor
chaplain lay in the open, but was soon carried in
and conveyed to the field hospital. He was
conscious for a while and cheerful, though he
knew his hours were numbered. He was able
to greet Chaplains F. Colwell and G. T. Walden,
who had just arrived with Colonel Holmes's
Australian Brigade, and Chaplain J. M. Dale of
Brisbane. Before two o'clock he was dead, dying
as he had lived, a gallant Christian soldier.</p>

<p>That night, wrapped in a Union Jack, he was
buried. It was bright moonlight. Out in the
Ægean the warships and hospital ships lay passive.
Back in the hills sounded the ceaseless rattle of
musketry. Chaplain-Colonel E. N. Merrington
conducted a brief service, at which were chaplains
of all denominations and several officers and men
of his brigade and battalion. The little shallow
grave lies a couple of miles north of Anzac, on
the edge of the five-mile beach that stretches on
to Suvla Bay. As with the hero of Corunna,
"we carved not a line, and we raised not a stone&mdash;but
we left him alone with his glory." His comrades
went back to the firing-line with the memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
of his self-sacrifice to cheer them on. And we
thought then of Longfellow's beautiful lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dust thou art, to dust returneth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was not spoken of the soul.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Soon the battalion will erect a little wooden
cross over his grave&mdash;one more of those little
wooden crosses that are so numerous on Gallipoli.
We who knew and loved him will never forget
Andrew Gillison.</p>

<p class="mt2">Non-commissioned officers are the backbone
of the British army!</p>

<p>This is high praise, of course, yet it is well
merited; and I think the same tribute can be
paid to the non-coms. of the Australian Imperial
Force.</p>

<p>For our non-coms. hold their office by virtue
of their merit. It is simply a case of the survival
of the fittest. We all started off scratch. There
was keen competition for stripes when our regiment
was first formed. The best men were
selected. There was no favouritism. Some old
soldiers had an initial advantage, but all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
appointments were provisional at first, and they
were all tried in the crucible. Only the pure
gold was retained; the baser metal was rejected.</p>

<p>The result was that when the 6th Light Horse
Regiment left Sydney it had a body of non-commissioned
officers who would compare favourably
with any in the world. It was a great pity that
the people of Sydney never saw the "Fighting
Sixth" ride through the metropolis. In Egypt
they were reckoned the best mounted regiment
that ever left Australia. The limelight has been
turned right on to subsequent volunteers. Other
contingents&mdash;months and months and months
after we left&mdash;bathed in the smiles of the multitude.
Special trains were run in order that the
country folk should see them. But our brigade,
the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, comprising the
5th, 6th and 7th L.H. Regiments, were hunted
off like thieves in the night. In deadly secrecy
we struck camp. In the dawn hush we stealthily
slunk through the city streets. We were all on
board the transports before Sydney was well
awake. The papers were not allowed to publish
a line about our departure. So the country
folk came to see their sons and brothers off&mdash;too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
late. The whole city knew it&mdash;too late. Every
German spy in Australia knew it&mdash;early. When
we arrived at Aden a nigger on the gangway of
the transport told us to a man the constitution of
the force, the number of ships, and our destination.
So cleverly had our censors concealed
our movements!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So it is a pity the brigade never rode with
clinking snaffles and clanking stirrups through
the city&mdash;more for the sake of the city than the
soldiers themselves. Also because many of our
soldiers will never again see George Street, or
Pitt Street, or Martin Place, or Macquarie Street.
The wastage of war has had its effect. We have
been under fire day and night. Snipers have
taken their toll. Machine-guns have added to
the casualties. Shrapnel shells and high explosives
have torn gaps in our ranks. In killed and wounded
we have lost over half our original strength.</p>

<p>There were three sergeants of the 6th Light
Horse Regiment, who now are resting in little
shallow graves in Gallipoli. Never again will they
watch the sun go down in splendour into the
Ægean Sea. When we go marching into Berlin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
they will be with us&mdash;but only in spirit; and
when the war is over and the boys from the bush
ride home again, there will be three sergeants
missing. But their names will be emblazoned
on Australia's roll of honour. And we of the
Sixth won't forget Sergeant Sid Parkes, Sergeant
F. R. Tresilian, and Sergeant Fred Ellis.</p>

<p>Sid Parkes was small and slight, so small that
he was almost rejected by the medical examiner.
He had to show his South African record, and
remind the doctor that giants were not wanted
in the Light Horse, but light, active, wiry horsemen.
So he just scraped through and went into
camp. I remember him at Rosebery Park. Not
much over five feet three, only about nine stone,
but active and strong. He knew his mounted
drill like a book, and he knew how to handle men;
so he soon got his three stripes&mdash;and stuck to
them. The men liked him. The officers appreciated
him. We saw several other sergeants made
and unmade, but Parkes of B Squadron was a
fixture.</p>

<p>Already he had seen four years' peace service,
and eighteen months' active service in South
Africa with the New South Wales Mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Rifles. So he brought the lessons of his previous
experience to bear on his new job. On parade
he did his duty well. Off duty he was a humorist,
and as care-free as a schoolboy. On the transport
he entered into all the fun going. In Egypt
he played the game. Somehow, I always thought
Parkes would come safely through the war.
We joked together the night we first went into
the trenches, never anticipating ill. Yet he was
the first man of the regiment killed in the trenches.
A sniper's bullet came through a loophole and
killed him on the spot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Frederick George Ellis, sergeant in C Squadron,
was an Englishman from Hants. He had spent
five years in the Royal Navy, some of the time
on the China station. He was one of the few
survivors of H.M.S. <i>Tiger</i>, which was rammed
and sunk during the naval man&oelig;uvres off
Spithead. Three years ago he came to Australia
to get colonial experience, prior to settling on
the land. A few years in the nor'-west, at Bogamildi
and Terala stations, transformed the sailor
into a bushman. So he came to Sydney when war
broke out, and joined the 6th Light Horse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
He rose to be lance-sergeant. On July 12 he
was killed by a shrapnel shell on Holly Ridge.
Several of our fellows were killed and wounded
that day, for the Turks dropped 200 shells on
the Light Horse lines, and for an hour or two
it was terrific.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A strong, dominant personality was Tresilian,
one of the very best troop sergeants that ever
joined the Light Horse. He seemed to love the
firing-line like home. He was quite fearless.
Somehow he seemed to revel in the roar of battle.
On one occasion the Turks sent a dozen shells at
our little section of the trenches, smashing down
the parapets, making the place a wreck, wounding
two men, and half blinding, half deafening, half
choking, half burying six of us. When I could
see and hear and breathe again I saw Tresilian
laughing merrily. "Hello, Bluegum," he said,
"not killed yet?"</p>

<p>He came from Humula, near Wagga, where his
people were well-known farmers. Till a young
man he remained on the farm, and was known
throughout the district as a good "sport"&mdash;a
good cricketer and footballer, and a fine rider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
and shot, just the typical Australian Light
Horseman, though more sturdily built than the
average. He tired, however, of the farm, and
yearned for the freer life of the Western plains.
So he tackled station life, became a station
manager, rode over the whole of the north-west,
went to the Northern Territory in search of
pastoral lands, and when the war broke out was
managing a station in the Boggabri district.
He had seen service in South Africa, and he once
more volunteered to serve the King.</p>

<p>On Gallipoli his scouting and patrol work were
excellent. He seemed to have a charmed life,
for he had many narrow escapes in the open and
in the trenches. On the day he was killed a
bullet whizzed past his head, just wounding his
cheek slightly. Later on he and Sergeant Paddy
Ryan were putting barbed wire entanglements
in front of our trenches. A sniper's rifle cracked.
Ryan escaped. Tresilian fell dead.</p>

<p class="mt2">"Serves 'em right, for sinking our mails and
spilling our rum!"</p>

<p>This remark broke from the angry lips of one
of our Light Horsemen as our artillery inflicted
a terrific bombardment on the enemy. The
Turks replied vigorously, and the result was an
inferno; shells bursting everywhere, gaping
holes torn in the inoffensive earth, trench parapets
levelled, soldiers slaughtered. Then, as our
warships steamed up and added their quota to
the conflict, the trooper reiterated, "Serve
'em right!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment we wondered what he was driving
at. Then we remembered that a few days ago
some unlucky Turkish shells had landed on a
barge coming from one of the supply ships to
Anzac, and had sunk it. This caused us but
slight concern till we found out that several casks
of rum were spilled, and 250 bags of mails from
Australia were sent to the bottom of the sea.
Then, as our ships' guns sent another salvo,
we too exclaimed, "Serve 'em right."</p>

<p>We did not mind the rum so much, for the
Army Service Corps had quite enough on hand
for our ration when the issue was due. But
every Australian on Gallipoli bitterly resented
the loss of the mails. It made us really angry.
Some of our chaps reckoned that the loss of the
mails and rum was the prime cause of the big
battle which ensued during the early days of
August. So they have called it the Battle of
Mail Rum. Historians, however, will probably
call this sanguinary struggle the Battle of Suvla
Bay.</p>

<p>Good folk at home, and even of the out-back
country, receive mails pretty regularly. We
get ours once a fortnight, or once a month, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
at even longer intervals. I do not join in the
general chorus of condemnation of our postal
service, for since the time I enlisted nearly twelve
months ago all my letters and parcels have come
duly to hand, while, so far as I know, none of
my letters to Australia have gone astray. When
we came to Gallipoli we naturally expected some
break in the continuity of the service&mdash;and
we got it. One reason is that, while the New
Zealanders provided an up-to-date, well-equipped
postal service, the Australians had only a skeleton
postal corps&mdash;shockingly undermanned. Hence
the congestion at Alexandria and Lemnos and the
belated arrival of letters at Anzac.</p>

<p>There is nothing that cheers the soldiers up so
much as letters from home. You see their eyes
light up with pleasure as the postal orderlies
toil up the hill with the mail bags. The postal
corporal is the most popular man in the army.
But he always seems so slow with his sorting.
Those of us not in the trenches crowd round
him and pounce eagerly on our precious missives.
I have seen a great, hulking, swearing, unshaven
trooper grab his letter, sneak into his dug-out,
and kiss reverently some love-letter from a sweetheart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
back in sunny New South Wales; or
perhaps it was from his mother or sister away
in the great West land. And I've seen anxious
troopers, with yearning eyes, hang round till the
last letter and postcard were sorted&mdash;then wander
away silently, and gaze dry-eyed over the blue
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Some of our fellows are married men, and
some of these married men used jokingly to
say that they had enlisted to get away from ...
never mind; but I know that there was not one
of them but spent half his time thinking of the
old and the middle-aged and the young folks at
home&mdash;not one of them but would have given
the world to be able to take a peep at the wife who
scanned the casualty lists so eagerly as they
appeared in the papers, and the kiddies who
strutted round proudly, saying, "Daddy's gone
to the war."</p>

<p>It's cruel to be forgotten by the home folk
when fighting the battles of one's country; but
most of our chaps are loyal, and they always
blamed the post office. One time our 6th L.H.
Regiment mail had not arrived, and I stood by
miserably watching other lucky devils getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
their letters. Suddenly my eye caught the
address on a newspaper, "To any lonely soldier
in the Australian army." I immediately grabbed
it. There was a protest from the postal official,
who said the paper was not addressed to me,
and that unclaimed papers are considered as
"baksheesh" for the postal corporal. I pointed
out that it was not unclaimed, since I had claimed
it; and that as I at that moment was a lonely
soldier it was clearly addressed to me. There
was a fine row, but I won my case&mdash;and the paper.</p>

<p>Always at the end of the sorting there are
many, many letters unclaimed. And the Regimental
Sergeant-Major goes through the list,
and with heavy red pencil writes "killed,"
"wounded," or "missing" on the envelope.
What a tragedy lies hidden in these little heaps
of letters to dead soldiers who can never read
them!</p>

<p>It was no small loss, that barge with 250 mail
bags from Australia. When I saw the barge
sink I repeated the prayer of the popular English
preacher, who exclaimed, "God damn the Sultan!"
Why should that love-laden barge be
the mark for the Turkish gunners? And why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
after the hundreds of boats they have missed,
should they get a bull's-eye there? It is sad to
think of the thousands of soldiers who will never
know the loving thoughts penned in those precious
missives. Many will wonder why friends and
relations have never written. And folks at home
will be wondering why they got no answer.</p>

<p>For a time we simply could not write home.
There was an envelope famine on <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Gallipol.'">Gallipoli.</ins>
Not a single envelope could be had for love or
money. We readdressed our old envelopes,
or turned them inside out. We made post cards
out of cardboard and cigarette boxes. Some
of us even wrote home on the biscuits, which
were warranted not to break. We waylaid
sailors on the beach and offered fabulous prices
for paper and envelopes. We wrote to our friends
in Ma'adi and to the stores in Alexandria. But
it's a long, long way to Egypt, and it seemed a
long, long time before the envelope famine was
relieved. That's one reason why some of our
chaps never wrote home. Another reason was
that we were all so tired after our turn in the
trenches and the eternal "dig on, dig ever." As
for stamps, everybody in Australia knows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
legend on the soldier's envelope: "No stamps
available."</p>

<p>Some of the letters home were delightfully
ingenuous. Nearly all were brimful of cheerfulness.
Now and then there was a growl; but
we knew it wouldn't help the home folk if we
complained, so I might paraphrase the Psalmist
and say that all our men were liars&mdash;cheerful
liars. I told you of the trooper who wrote
home, "Dear aunt, this war is a fair cow."
But that was exceptional. Most of the soldiers
told cheerful lies about the good time they were
having, the romance of war, the excitement of
battle, and the exhilaration of victory. They told
of the tricks they played on the Turks, the
dummies they held above the parapets for Abdul
to snipe at, the "stunts" for drawing the fire
from the enemy's trenches, the risky excitement
of bomb duels, the joy of swimming while "Beachy
Bill" was showering shrapnel over them, and the
extortionate rates charged by the sailor on the
beach for condensed milk and chocolates.</p>

<p>But a real "grouse"&mdash;never. Well, hardly
ever. And when there was one, depend upon it
there was some good reason for it. I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
one. It was when a man in Australia wrote to a
friend at Anzac: "We're having a rather bad
drought in this district; you're well out of it."
The man at Anzac fairly lost his temper. He
wrote back: "Come over here." And after
painting a picture of a battle or two&mdash;a real
growl, if ever there was one&mdash;he concluded:
"It's nearly as bad as your drought, and you're
'well out of it'."</p>

<p>Later, I was told, these two men met on the
bloodstained fields of Gallipoli.</p>

<p class="mt2">At last the Second Australian Division arrived
in Gallipoli, and their advent meant that we
of the First Australian Division would get a well-earned
relief&mdash;and "for this relief much thanks."</p>

<p>We had been waiting for some time for our
comrades to come and take over the trenches,
and it was good for our tired eyes when we saw
General Holmes and his 5th Infantry Brigade
landing on Gallipoli.</p>

<p>We note that nearly all the new-comers had
the name of their home town printed in indelible
ink on the front of their hats. So it felt just like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
railway journey all over New South Wales to
see the brigade marching by. There we saw
Bathurst, Maitland, Goulburn, Glen Innes, Wellington,
Dubbo, Kiama, Kempsey, Moree, Cootamundra,
Albury, Hay, Dungog, Tamworth,
Nowra, Narrandera, Yass, and scores of other
towns and villages scattered over the length and
breadth of New South Wales. The next thing
we noted was that all the new-comers looked big
and strong and fit. They looked just like our
First Australian Division when it marched out of
Mena.</p>

<p>General Legge and the Headquarters Staff of
the Second Division had a lot of luck getting to
Gallipoli at all, for the <i>Southland</i> was torpedoed
with them on board. It is believed that an
Austrian submarine did it. Our casualties were
about twenty killed and fifteen drowned, Brigadier-General
Linton dying after he was rescued
from the water. It happened at about ten o'clock
on the morning of September 2. The S.O.S.
wireless signal was immediately sent off, and
seven boats eventually steamed up to the rescue.
The troops behaved magnificently, and were all
put into the boats without much trouble. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
firemen and stewards, however, got panicky,
and three were shot before they sobered down.</p>

<p>But the <i>Southland</i> did not sink. So the skipper
called for volunteers to take the ship back to
Lemnos, and fifty Australians took on the job.
General Legge and Staff stayed on board also.
One soldier had a stroke of luck. He was blown
unhurt into the air, and by the time he came down
the water was in the hold, and he landed softly
and safely.</p>

<p>The behaviour of our troops upon the <i>Southland</i>
is to be numbered among the grand things of this
war&mdash;one of the grandest. It has been likened
to the <i>Birkenhead</i>.</p>

<p>When the Second Australian Division arrived
how few of the old hands were left from the
heroic band that landed on April 25! Just to
show something of the wastage of war, here are
some authentic figures. Of the 1,200 men in the
3rd Battalion who marched out of Kensington
Racecourse, 100 were left. Eleven hundred were
among the killed, wounded, missing and sick. Of
the original sergeant's mess of the same battalion
fifty-six left Kensington; five remained, and
of these four were officers. The original G Comp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>any
had 121 men&mdash;eight are left. Of the
original 2nd Battalion, sixty remain out of 1,200.
Of course, the majority of these are sick and
wounded, and will rejoin their battalions. It
is the immediate wastage that affects the army.
That's why we want a continual stream of
reinforcements.</p>

<p>Of the First Australian Division there remained
on Anzac only the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, and
the 3rd Infantry Brigade&mdash;plus, of course, the
artillery and engineers. We were daily expecting
to get our well-earned spell, and retire to the
islands of the blessed in the Ægean Sea.</p>

<p>General Ryrie's brigade of Light Horsemen
had their fair share of casualties. Of the original
three regiments, Lieutenant-Colonel Cox's 6th,
Lieutenant-Colonel Harris's 5th, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Arnott's 7th, had 110 killed, 550 wounded
and 1,050 sick with dysentery and enteric and
other ills, or a total of 1,710 casualties. But
the reinforcements kept us fairly up to strength.</p>

<p>Brigadier-General Ryrie, the brigade-major,
Major Foster, and the staff captain, Captain
Pollok, were all wounded. Of the fifty New South
Wales officers of the brigade who landed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Gallipoli, the orderly-officer, Lieutenant Hogue,
and the adjutant of the 6th Light Horse, Captain
Somerville, were the only two who had not been
killed, wounded or sick. A great many officers
who had been sick and wounded, after a month
or two in hospital returned to duty.</p>

<p>The landing of the 3rd Brigade, and the subsequent
terrific three days' fighting on the heights
of Gallipoli by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Brigades
made Wolfe's exploit on the Heights of Abraham
sound like a picnic. The thrilling capture of
Lone Pine by the 1st Brigade was one of the
finest exploits of the war, while the splendid
defence of that stronghold by the 2nd Infantry
Brigade and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade against
the repeated counter-attacks of the Turks was
worthy of all praise. The magnificent charge
of the 2nd Infantry Brigade down at Helles
made the British and French troops thrill with
pride. The charge of the 1st Light Horse Brigade
at Walker's Ridge was a glorious sacrifice.
Australians have every reason always to be proud
of the first fights of her First Division.</p>

<p>THE NEW WARFARE&mdash;ALTOGETHER UTILITARIAN&mdash;ITS
HUMOUR AND PATHOS&mdash;THE LUCK OF THE
GAME&mdash;GOD'S ACRE&mdash;AERIAL WARFARE&mdash;GALLANT
DEEDS&mdash;GENERAL RYRIE</p></div>


<p class="mt2">My dug-out overlooked Shell Green.</p>

<p>From the comparative safety of this
retreat I could sit and watch the pomp and
circumstance of war, its pageantry and pathos.</p>

<p>To be sure there was little that was picturesque
in war as we saw it in Gallipoli. There was no
martial music. The "thin red line" had given
place to drab khaki. There were no fiery war-horses
with tossing manes and champing bits, no
dashing cavalrymen with flashing sabres. There
were no gun teams, spanking bays and blacks,
for we had to man-handle the guns up and down
the hills into action. The nearest approach to a
pageant was when the British fleet flew along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the Ægean waterway, and fired some reverberating
salvos at the Turkish batteries.</p>

<p>Ashore all was strictly utilitarian; no ceremony,
no display. It was midsummer, so we curtailed
our trousers and wore shorts. Our shirts were
sleeveless. Putties and leggings were mostly
discarded. When out of the trenches shirts
were usually considered superfluous. Our backs
and arms and legs were so sun-tanned that the
brownest of the beach surfers at Bondi would
envy our complexions. So when on fatigues or
off duty it was a tatterdemalion army that
marched to and fro over Shell Green.</p>

<p>Humour and pathos were strangely intermingled.
We saw after a skirmish a score of
fine young Australians laid out for burial, wounds
gaping and clothes blood-clotted. Our hearts
were wrung with anguish for mothers and sisters
and wives back in the great South Land, ignorant
as yet of their bereavement. A minute later
the antics of some humorist would set the camp
roaring with laughter. Anon some of our chaps
would be wounded, and carried in on stretchers;
then some bolting mules or a wrecked dug-out,
or an explosion in the commissariat would set us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
laughing again. It is this saving grace of humour,
as I have written before, that made life worth living
in Gallipoli; but it also made the Gurkhas and the
Tommies wonder what manner of men we were.
The Englishmen regarded the Gallipoli campaign
with great seriousness. The Indians appeared
stoically indifferent. The Australians regard the
whole show as a great adventure.</p>

<p>It's not hard to guess how Shell Green got its
name. No gift for nomenclature is needed to
find names for Hell Spit, Casualty Corner, The
Bloody Angle, or Shell Green. The whole green
is pitted with holes made by the enemy's shells.
Some months ago these shells played havoc with
our men. Some were killed as they lay in their
dug-outs, others slaughtered on their way to and
from the beach, some while in swimming. But
we learned our lesson. We got to know the safety
spots and the danger zones. Day after day the
shells fell harmlessly, pock-marking the face of
the earth, but doing us no ill. The Turks thought
we had guns on Shell Green. So when our artillery
got busy, the Turks blazed away, "searching"
the area. But after four months' searching they
failed to silence our guns. The remarks of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
troopers as the shells landed were many and
varied, but all were inspired by a quaint, unquenchable
humour. When the quartermaster's
store of the 4th Light Horse was wrecked, and
four soldiers crawled uninjured from the débris,
their mates called out, "Your luck's in. Get a
ticket in Tatt.'s."</p>

<p>There are many graves on Shell Green&mdash;graves
of Australian heroes. There's a little God's acre
near the crest of the hill, overlooking the blue
Ægean Sea. Sometimes towards evening the
Turks tired of their fierce fusillade, and all seemed
peaceful and quiet. The report of an odd sniper's
rifle sounded more like the crack of a stock-whip.
The sun sank in splendour on Samothrace, and
the gloaming hour was sweet with meditation and
thoughts of home. It darkened, and only the
searchlights of the destroyers and the green streak
of the hospital ship reminded us of war. We had
our burials mostly in the evening. The padre
came along, and a few of the dead soldier's friends
straggled down from the trenches. The services
were short but impressive. The shallow grave
was filled in, and a rude cross marked the spot.
Here's where we buried Colonel Harris, the loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
leader of the 5th; Lieutenant Robson, the
genial quartermaster of the 6th; Lieutenant
Thorne, the brilliant Duntroon footballer, of the
7th; giant Gordon Flanagan, who was shot
through the heart while asleep in his dug-out;
Tresilian, the dare-devil sergeant, who revelled in
battle; and many more gallant horsemen of the
2nd Brigade, who will never more hear the réveillé.</p>

<p>Shells and bullets were not the only things
that flew over Shell Green. Aeroplanes were
frequent visitors. Mostly they were French or
British, but now and then a German Taube
streaked overhead, dropped a bomb or two, or a
shower of darts, and then bolted for safety back
to Turkish territory. So far we had not witnessed
a duel in the heavens. It's about the one thing
we missed. Several times we saw our airmen give
chase to the Germans, but the latter never waited
for a bout. One day we thought we were going to
see an aerial scrap, and like rabbits from their burrows,
the whole troglodyte population of Shell
Green emerged from their dug-outs to witness the
spectacle. A Taube appeared over Suvla Bay, and
a British airman took the air at Helles, and started
in pursuit. The anti-aircraft guns of the Turks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
opened on our plane, and flecked the blue with a
dozen shells, but scored no hit. Our gunners
opened on the Taube, and made far better practice
than the enemy, but could not bring the machine
to earth. The two planes streaked across the
sky like huge eagles, with outstretched wings.
The Taube man&oelig;uvred over the German guns,
and our airman followed, despite the unfriendly
greeting of the landlubbers below. We on Anzac
focussed our binoculars and strained our eyes till
the fliers passed beyond the hills. Finally we
heard the Taube had justified the maxim, "Discretion
is the better part of valour." Just as the
aerial exhibition was over a couple of high explosives
burst on Shell Green, and the "rabbits"
bolted once more to their burrows.</p>

<p>It is the little incidents that relieve the monotony
of war. I have seen some gallant deeds done
here on Shell Green. One day a shell cut a
telephone line between our observation post and a
battery. It happened to be right on the most
dangerous spot on the Green. But without a
moment's hesitation a signaller sauntered out
established the connexion, and sauntered back,
despite the shrapnel. I saw Captain Evans, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>little medical officer of the 7th, time and again
streaking across the danger zone and tending men
under fire. I have heard the cry, "Stretcher-bearers,"
and on the instant the devoted A.M.C.
men have grabbed stretchers, and bolted to the
rescue; this not once, but a hundred times.
Some day I'll get a virgin vellum roll, a pen richly
chased and jewelled, and in letters of gold I'll try
to tell the people of Australia something of the
heroism of these stretcher-bearers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="Ryrie"></a>

  <span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Brigadier-General G. Ryrie.</span></span>
  </div>

<p class="mt2">It was on Shell Green that the genial General
Ryrie was injured. If he had been more careful
of his own skin he would have got off scot-free.
But a shell had just landed amongst the "rabbits,"
and the cry of "Stretcher-bearers" told us that
some of the boys had stopped a bit of shrapnel.
Without a second's thought General Ryrie walked
out on to the Green from headquarters with his
brigade major and orderly officer.... "You
know, Foster," he said to the former, "they could
get us here too."</p>

<p>No sooner were the words out of his mouth
than there was a crash. Shrapnel splinters and
pellets zipped all round us. The cook's camp
was a wreck. Pots and pans were perforated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
prettily. For a second I thought that no one
was hit, for cook crawled out of the débris grinning.
Then I heard the General in his cheery voice
exclaim: "Holy Moses, they've got me where the
chicken got the axe."</p>

<p>It was a close shave. The bullet entered the
right side of the neck, penetrated a few inches,
and stopped right on the sheath of the carotid
artery. A fraction of an inch further and it would
have been "Good night, nurse." ... That night
the old brigadier was taken off to the hospital
ship and on to Alexandria. Colonel Cox of our
6th Light Horse Regiment took temporary
command of our brigade.</p>

<p class="mt2">As there passes before my mind's eye a
kaleidoscopic picture of the wildly hilarious
fighting of the early days of Anzac, and the rough
and tumble jumble of Lone Pine, I can't help
thinking of the luck of the game. "Were honour
to bestow her crowns on those who had a right
to them, the skull up on the battlefield would
often wear a diadem."</p>

<p>So many unknown heroes lie buried on Anzac.
So many passed the crucial test of supreme trial
and with strong arm and true heart performed
prodigies of valour&mdash;but no one saw them. As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
rule there was hardly time to take stock of everything.
Time and again did individual Australians
do great deeds, but the historians will never know
of it. They are mostly too modest to talk of it.
And the officers who might have reported and
recommended are dead.</p>

<p>Take that wonderful landing on the fateful day,
April 25, when Australia made such a gloriously
picturesque début. How many men of Maclagan's
gallant 3rd Brigade in that never-to-be-forgotten
charge up the heights won the greatest
military honour that the King can bestow. But
so many officers were picked off; so many men
really deserved the V.C. The only solution seemed
to be the conferring of the coveted medal on the
whole brigade. But there was no precedent for
this. So none of them got it.</p>

<p>Our first Australian V.C. was young Jacka
of the 4th Brigade. He was young and not of the
splendid physique of most of the Australians, but
he was greased lightning with the bayonet. It
all happened on Courtney's Post. The Turks had
been sapping in towards the front trench, and
after a shower of bombs they swarmed in and
captured the trench. But Lance-corporal Jacka,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
posted behind the traverse in the fire trench,
blocked their advance. An officer and a few men
hurried up and volunteers were immediately
ready to eject the intruders. Then while the
officer and three men engaged in a bombing
exchange with Abdul, Albert Jacka jumped from
the front trench into the communication trench
behind, ran round and took the Turks in the rear.
He shot five of them and bayoneted two. The
officer's party then charged and shot the four
remaining Turks who tried to escape. They found
Jacka leaning up against the side of the trench
with flushed face, a bloody bayonet in the end of
his rifle and an unlighted cigarette in his mouth.</p>

<p>The boys that took Lone Pine, who did that fine
charge amid a shower of lead and shrapnel such as
the war had not previously seen, got no V.C. for
their valour. But the lads who held the hard-won
post against all the subsequent counter-attacks
did manage to secure a few. One of these
was Captain Shout. But he never lived to wear
the cross. For three long days and longer nights
he participated in the furious hand-to-hand fighting
in Lone Pine. Captain Sass and Lieutenant
Howell Price both did great deeds in that thrilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
time and each had several scalps to their credit.
But Captain Shout with his bombing gang was
ubiquitous. Laughing and cheering them on he
time and again drove the Turks back, and then
when he reached a point where the final sandbag
barrier was to be erected, he tried to light three
bombs at once and throw them amongst the
crowding Turks. To throw a single bomb is a
risky job. To throw three bombs simultaneously
was a desperate expedient. One exploded prematurely,
shattered both his hands, laid open his
cheek and destroyed an eye, besides minor
injuries. Conscious and still cheerful he was
carried away. But he died shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>The heroic Seventh Battalion&mdash;victorious
Victorians&mdash;participated in the great charge of
the 2nd Australian Infantry Brigade down at
Helles; the charge that made the French and
English marvel at the dash of the young colonials.
Then the Seventh managed to bag four V.C.'s in
Lone Pine. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade and
2nd Infantry Brigade were holding the line against
repeated counter-attacks, and it was then that
Captain Fred Tubb, Lieutenant Symons, Corporal
Dunstan and Corporal Burton won the V.C.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
On the night of August 8, while the British troops
in the Suvla area were struggling to wrest the hills
from the Turks, the Turks round Lone Pine were
vainly endeavouring to recapture this stronghold
from the Australians. On the right of the 7th
Battalion things were particularly sultry, and
early on the morning of the 9th some determined
attacks by Abdul resulted in six of our officers and
several men being killed and wounded. A bit of
the front sap was lost, but Lieutenant Symons
headed a charge, retook the sap, shot two of the
Turks with his revolver and finally erected a
barricade which defied all the attacks of the
enemy. It was a bitter struggle and Abdul set
fire to the overhead cover in the hope of driving
back the Seventh. But the fire was extinguished
and the position held for good.</p>

<p>It was give and take, attack and counter-attack
all through August 9, that showed the qualities of
pluck and determination which won the V.C.
for Captain F. H. Tubb, Corporal Dunstan and
Corporal Burton. Three times the enemy attacked
with bombs, blew up our barricades, and
swarmed into the trench, but each time Tubb and
his companions returned to the assault, repulsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
the invaders, rebuilt the barricades, and in spite
of a shower of bombs held the post. Captain
Tubb was wounded in the head and arm, but stuck
to his job and baffled all Abdul's machinations.</p>

<p>Lance-corporal Keyzor was one of a band of
heroes who did wonders in the hell-zone at the
south-eastern corner of Lone Pine. It was a
murder hole and after much slaughter we found
that we could not hold the outer trench, while
Abdul found that he also was unable to hold it.
Finally it was abandoned as no man's land. But
round about here there were lively times during
August. As a bomb-thrower, Keyzor was pre-eminent.
He was one of those who repeatedly
caught the enemy's bombs and hurled them back
before they could explode. It was here that
Colonel Scobie was killed shortly afterwards, and
here it was that for days and nights Keyzor moved
amongst the showers of bombs with dead and
dying all around, and threw bombs till every
muscle ached and he could not lift his arm.</p>

<p>Young Hamilton was very young. But lots of
these young Australians had old heads on their
young shoulders. It was at Lone Pine where the
3rd Battalion was defending a section of the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
against the repeated attacks of the Turks that
young Hamilton won the coveted honour. He
climbed on to the top of the parapet and with a
few sandbags as a precarious shield against bombs
and bullets he stayed there for five solid hours
sniping merrily, potting off any stray Turks that
showed up, and giving warning to the officer
below each time the enemy started out to attack.
There was plenty of shrapnel flying and the zip of
bullets into the sandbags grew monotonous. But
young Hamilton hung on.</p>

<p>It was away on the left of our line at Hill 60
that Lieutenant Throssell of the 10th Light Horse
performed his great act of valour. There was one
section of the enemy's line that obstinately defied
the Australasian attack. At last the 3rd Light
Horse Brigade received orders that the redoubt
had to be taken. The brigadier sent the 10th
Light Horse Regiment out to do the job. Just
after midnight&mdash;August 28-29&mdash;the Westralians
suddenly leaped on to the parapet and charged
ahead. They were met with a hail of machine-gun
and rifle fire and a shower of bombs, but nothing
could stop those horseless horsemen. A brief
mêlée on and in the Turkish trenches and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
position was won. But holding it was a far
more difficult matter. Lieutenant Throssell in
charge of the digging party worked overtime
putting the new line in a state of defence. Soon
the Turks massed for the inevitable counter-attack,
and Throssell, with Captain Fry and a
troop of the Light Horse, repulsed the first charge.
But just as dawn was breaking the Turks came
again with a shower of bombs as a prelude. The
grenades were smothered as they fell or thrown
back again, but Captain Fry paid the final penalty.
One bomb rolled over the parapet into the trench,
and spluttered. The men yelled "Let it rip."
But the only safe thing to do was to smother the
bomb or heave it out. The gallant captain
chose the latter alternative, but the bomb exploded
and killed him. The holding of this threatened
elbow of the line devolved upon Throssell, who
rose manfully to the occasion. With his rifle
he shot half a dozen Turks and with his cheery
example he heartened his command, and Abdul
attacked in vain. Twice indeed they swarmed in
and the Light Horsemen had to give ground.
But only a few yards and a fresh barricade was
immediately erected. Early in the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
Throssell was wounded in the shoulder. But he
kept on. At four o'clock he got another bullet
in the neck. He kept on. Then just after
nightfall relief came and his superior officer sent
him back to the field hospital.</p>

<p>There were other Australians who gained the
V.C.&mdash;Captain Hawker of the Flying Corps,
Corporal William Cosgrove of the Royal Munster
Fusiliers, who did such a fine performance down
at Helles, and others. But other historians will
tell of their deeds. Corporal Bassett of the New
Zealand Signallers won his V.C. for a daring exploit&mdash;laying
a telephone wire right on to Chunuk Bair
in broad daylight under a heavy fire. But Maori-land
will do him full justice.</p>

<p>The 2nd Light Horse Brigade had a sultry time
in Lone Pine during August. After the big
attack early in August they complained that for
twenty-four hours they did nothing but bury dead
Turks. The stench was shocking&mdash;sickening.
There was no time for decent burial. Dozens of
Turks were placed in the short communication
trenches between the lines and covered up with
earth, and the ends of the trench bagged up.
Partly to kill the insufferable stench the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
smoked dozens and dozens of cigarettes....
Later on the boys had more than their share of the
bombing. Sergeant Ryan won the D.C.M. But
scores of the boys did big things that in lesser
wars would have won distinction. Here they just
were numbered with the unknown heroes. Every
man on Lone Pine deserved special honour. If
they had been Germans they would have been
covered with iron crosses. As it is they are just
satisfied that they were able to do their job.
Anyhow, Australia won't forget Lone Pine.</p>

<p class="mt2">Days dragged drearily on. Pessimism peeped
into the trenches. Later in the solitude
of the dug-out pessimism stayed an unwelcome
guest, and would not be banished. All the
glorious optimism of April, the confidence of May,
June and July had gone, and the dogged determination
of August, September and October was
fast petering out. Abdul had fringed the dominating
hills with barbed-wire and bayonets, and in
very surety Australia was "up against it."</p>

<p>Not that any one dared talk pessimism. The
croakers would have been squelched instanter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
But deep down there was a feeling that unless
heavy reinforcements arrived we could never
break through to Constantinople. But at Anzac
and Suvla the British hung on, desperately,
heroically.</p>

<p>September's cold snap was forgotten in the
unexpected warmth of October&mdash;just like an
afterglow of summer. Then came the wintry
winds of November&mdash;and the blizzard.... Of
course we have snow in Australia. Kosciusko is
all the year round covered with a soft white
mantle. Down on Monaro it can be bleak and
wintry. And the old Blue Mountains now
and then enjoy a spell of sleet and snow....
But taking us by and large we are a warm-blooded
race, we Australians. That is why we viewed
the approach of winter with some concern. We
knew Abdul could never, never, never break
through our lines, and drive us&mdash;as Liman von
Sanders had boasted&mdash;into the sea. But we
were beginning to fear that we were a long, long
way from Constantinople.</p>

<p>The blizzard swooped down on Anzac. Just
like a shroud the white visitation settled on
Gallipoli. It was cold as a Monaro gale. Soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
crowded round the fires, and at night in the
trenches it was terribly hard to keep awake.
The cold was something to remember. We
could keep our hands a bit warm by giving
"five rounds rapid" and hugging the rifle barrel.
Talk about cold feet; we had heard of "cold feet"
when we were in Egypt. But this was the real
thing.... How we invoked rich blessings on
the heads of the Australian girls who had knitted
us those warm socks! How we cursed the
thieves along the lines of communication who
pillaged and pilfered, while the men in the firing-line
went begging! But through it all the
indomitable cheerfulness of the Australian soldier
would not be crushed. They laughed and joked
when their teeth chattered, so that clear articulation
was impossible.</p>

<p>To preserve some circulation they stamped
their feet till exhaustion bade them cease. But
the blizzard was inexorable. The cold permeated
everywhere. We got just a glimpse of what the
British army suffered in the Crimea.</p>

<p>Frost-bite was something to fear and dread.
It was agonizing. Hundreds of men were carried
down to the field hospitals and sent across to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Lemnos. There were scores of amputations
daily.... We had cursed the heat of July and
the plague of flies, but now we prayed for summer
again.</p>

<p>Now and then the English home papers blew
in and we eagerly scanned the pages of the dailies
for news of the war. We were astounded at the
tone of the criticism hurled at the Government.
So much of it was Party criticism, captious
criticism. So little of it was helpful constructive
criticism. In Parliament and in the Press the
critics were "agin the Gov'ment" rather than
against the Hun. We felt wonderfully proud of
our Australian papers, the <cite>Herald</cite> and <cite>Telegraph</cite>
and <cite>Argus</cite>. Also we were rather proud of the
commendable restraint of our politicians. Not
one word of captious criticism had there come
from responsible Australian papers and people.
We knew that mistakes had been made. We
knew that it was a big gamble sending the fleet
to hammer their way through without the aid
of an army. But we did not slang-wang the
Government. In the dark hour when everybody
was blaming everybody there was only one
message from Australia. Press and politicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
struck the same note. It was merely a reiteration
of the Prime Minister's message that the last
man and the last shilling in Australia were now
and always at the disposal of the Empire.</p>

<p>Then came talk of evacuation. It staggered
us. In the House of Commons and in the Press
columns were devoted to discussing the Dardanelles
question and evacuation was freely
recommended. The Australians rose in wrath
and exclaimed, "<em>We're d&mdash;&mdash;d if we'll evacuate.
We are going to see this game through</em>." It was
unthinkable that, having put our hands to the
plough, we could turn back. The Turks and
their German masters were kept well informed
of the discussions at home and it made them
tremendously cocky. England had practically
admitted failure. The great Dardanelles expedition&mdash;the
greatest crusade in the world&mdash;was
an admitted fiasco. Then the Turks reasoned
together. And they agreed that even "the
fool English" would never talk so much about
evacuation if it were even remotely likely. But
it was worth an army corps to Abdul, and it did
not make General Birdwood's task any easier.</p>

<p>Then Kitchener came. Many of us had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
him in Australia and South Africa. We had
confidence that he would see the thing through.
He landed on the beach and soon the word
buzzed through the dug-outs, up the gully, and
along the firing line. "K. of K." was on Anzac
and the boys off duty congregated to give him
a rousing welcome. He went round the Anzac
defences with General Birdwood, saw everything
and then started in to weigh the pros and cons
of a knotty problem.</p>

<p>Ever since the day of landing, we had discussed
in an offhand way the possibility of "getting
out." Not that we had ever considered it
remotely possible that we should ever turn back.
But just as a strategical and tactical exercise,
we had figured out how it might be done. And
it seemed that the job of getting out was fraught
with more potentialities of disaster than the
job of getting in. The landing on April 25
was responsible for some slaughter. The evacuation,
we reckoned, would be carnage. At
a most moderate computation 25 per cent. of
the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps
would have to be sacrificed to ensure the safe
withdrawal of the remainder. But of course this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
was only a theoretical exercise. It was really
outside the sphere of practical politics.</p>

<p>Then like a bomb came word that in very
surety we were going to evacuate. In the House
of Commons members had asked in an airy way
why the troops were not withdrawn from Suvla
and Anzac. To them, in their ignorance, it was
merely a matter of embarking again and returning
to Egypt or Salonica or France. So simple it
seemed to those armchair strategists. They did
not know that the beach at Anzac, our main depôts,
and our headquarters were within a thousand
yards of the main Turkish line; that the beach
had been constantly shelled by "Beachy Bill"
and other batteries for eight solid months on end.</p>

<p>However the powers that be had so ordained
it and that was sufficient. The Australians had
talked about "never retreating," but that was only
a manifestation of the unconquerable spirit that
animated them. They might talk, but they never
yet disobeyed an order. It nearly broke their
hearts to leave the spot where so many thousand
gallant young Australians had found heroes'
graves; but they knew how to obey orders.
The only kick was for the honour of being the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
last to leave. So many wanted to be amongst
the "die-hards."</p>

<p>It was to be a silent "get-away." Absolute
secrecy was essential for its success. It sounds
just like a wild bit of fiction. Just imagine the
possibility of withdrawing an army of 90,000
men with artillery, stores, field hospitals, mules
and horses, and all the vast impedimenta of war,
right from under the nose of an active enemy,
and all on a clear moonlight night. One single
traitor could have queered the whole pitch.
But British, Indians, New Zealanders and Australians
were loyal to the core.</p>

<p>The final attack of the Turks on the right of
our line had been repulsed by the 2nd Light Horse
Brigade, though the enemy in determined fashion
had pushed forward with sand-bags right to
within a few yards of our trenches. There were
half a dozen spots in the Anzac firing line where
we and the Turks could hear each other talking;
Quinn's Port, Lone Pine, The Neck, Apex, Turkish
Despair, Chatham's Post. It would be fine fun
sticking it out here while the army made its
get-away. Men clamoured for the honour of
being the last to leave....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the night of December 19; the fatal
night which will see the evacuation of Anzac.
Men talked cheerily, but thought hard. Had
the Turks any idea of our projected departure?
Two nights ago, a little after midnight, there was
an unrehearsed incident. A fire broke out in a
depôt near the North Beach. Soon the whole
sky was reddened with the glare and the rugged
outline of Anzac was brightly illuminated. Bully-beef
and biscuits blazed merrily. Oil drums
burst with terrific force. Then we wondered
if the Turks would deduce anything from this.
Would they guess it was a preliminary to the "get-away."
It was hardly likely. The "fool English"
would never burn the stores till the last minute.
So the accidental fire did no harm. Maybe it did
good. For during the past month the Anzacs
had tried by all manner of tricks and subterfuges
to induce Abdul to attack. But Abdul knew
how costly a business it was attacking the Australians,
and after a few abortive attempts he
remained on the defensive....</p>

<p>Now all was normal. Down at Helles the
British had, during the afternoon, made a big
demonstration. The warships had joined in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
fray and the bombardment of the Turkish lines
was terrific. But on this last night there was
nothing untoward happening. General Birdwood
during the day had gone the rounds of the
trenches and the boys yarned with him as of old.
It was a good thing for us to have had a General
like that&mdash;one who understood the gay devil-may-care
Australian character. That's why the boys
called him the "idol of Anzac."</p>

<p>Away to the northward at Suvla on the
shoulder of Chocolate Hills the British divisions
are getting ready to retire. On Hill 60, which saw
so much sanguinary fighting, the stolid Indians
are awaiting orders. This way a bit the New
Zealand and Australian Division has started its
first parties towards North Beach. On the right
above Anzac and opposite Gaba Tepe the Australians
were streaming away; all but the rearguard
and the final "die-hards." Before the
morning Anzac will have seen a great tragedy,
or else the greatest bluff in history.... There
is the usual desultory interchange of musketry
at odd places along the line, now and then
punctuated with the rattle of a maxim ...
nothing abnormal. Down at Helles there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
a fierce fusillade. This will help us....</p>

<p>Since dusk the first contingents had been steadily
streaming down towards the North Beach and
Anzac Cove. Quickly and silently they embarked
in the waiting flotilla of small craft and streaked
out to the transports. Like guardian angels the
warships hovered around seeing to the security
of the army. Up at Suvla we knew similar
scenes were being enacted. Along the line the
musketry played its usual accompaniment to the
intermittent bombing. But the whole plan was
working beautifully. The tension was gradually
relaxing. There would be no 20 per cent.
casualties as the pessimists foretold. Already
from Suvla and Anzac over 60,000 soldiers had
re-embarked without a single casualty.</p>

<p>Now and then there was a round of shrapnel
sent by Beachy Bill on to the southern depôt at
Brighton Beach. This clearly showed that the
enemy suspected nothing. Yet it is bright moonlight....
It is midnight, and nearly all the
men have embarked save the thin khaki line of
"die-hards" in the trenches. An odd bomb or
two is thrown by the Turks. The "die-hards"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
with insolent imperturbability heave a few bombs
back and invite Abdul to come on.</p>

<p>If Abdul had entered our trenches then he would
have found only a skeleton army waiting to
fight a forlorn hope rearguard action. But all
along the trenches he would have found other
things. Cigarettes and jam and tobacco; all
sorts of presents and Christmas boxes. Scores
of the boys before leaving wrote little farewell
messages to the Turks. Typical examples were
these:&mdash;"<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Au revoir</span>, Abdul. See you later on";
"Good-bye, Mahomet. Better luck next time";
"Abdul, you're a good clean fighter and we bear
you no ill-will"; "Merry Christmas, Abdul;
you're a good sport anyhow, but the Hun is a
fair cow"; "So long, Abdul." And having
told Abdul what he thought of him, the irresponsible
Australian sauntered down to the
beach and embarked! But many a silent tear
was shed for the pals they had left behind, the
quiet dead sleeping on Gallipoli....</p>

<p>It didn't seem quite right to clear out and leave
Australia's dead behind. Some of the boys
voiced the thought of many, "Tread softly,
boys, and don't let them hear us deserting them."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
Some of the padres planted wattle round about
the graves on Shell Green and Shrapnel Valley
and Hell Spit and Brown's Dip....</p>

<p>By half-past one all were away but the "die-hards."
Then from the Apex, after a final volley,
streaked the first batch of the skeleton rearguard.
There is a breach in the brave Anzac line
at last. But Abdul does not know it yet. Soon
the dare-devils at Quinn's Post heave a few bombs,
then silently slink back, down the precipitous
hill-side, and along the gully to the beach. From
Courtney's and the Neck and the Pimple and
Ryrie's Post and Chatham's all along the line
came the "die-hards," full lick to the beach.
But to their unutterable surprise there is no
attack. They are not followed. The trenches
that for eight long months defied the Turkish
attacks are now open, not a solitary soldier left.
But Abdul does not know it. There is still an
intermittent fire from the Turkish trenches.
They think our silence is some trick....</p>

<p>At half-past three on the morning of December
20 there was a burst of red flame and a roar like
distant thunder. This was repeated shortly
afterwards, and our two big mines on the Neck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
blew up. It was our last slap at the Turk. We
cannot say what harm it did, but thinking the
explosions were a prelude to attack the Turkish
line all round Anzac burst into spiteful protest.
There was a wild fusillade at our empty trenches,
and on the transports the Australians smiled
grimly. Shortly afterwards the Light Horsemen
on the extreme right&mdash;Ryrie's lucky Second
Brigade rearguard&mdash;entered the waiting cutters
on Brighton Beach. Then the stores&mdash;such as
we could not take away&mdash;burst into flame. Only
two men were wounded.</p>

<p>Before dawn word came that the whole force
had been safely taken off, together with many of
the mules and horses and guns which it was
thought would have to be abandoned. At dawn
the Turkish batteries opened a wild bombardment
of our trenches, all along the line. Marvellous
to relate the enemy had not yet ascertained what
had happened. But the silence soon told them
the truth. Then they charged in irregular lines
over the skyline at our empty trenches. The
warships fired a few salvoes at the enemy swarming
over the hills, and they hurriedly took cover
in our old trenches. These were the last shots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
fired over Anzac at the Turks. Then the flotilla
turned its back on Gallipoli and swung slowly and
sadly westward.</p>

<p>So ended the great "get-away"; a feat quite
unparalleled in the annals of war. Historians
will pay tribute to Sir Charles Munro and the
Fleet. We only take our hats off to General
Birdwood and his staff and the staffs of the
Australasian divisions. But deep down we know
the wonderful work our navy did during the eight
months of the Gallipoli campaign. The army
may make mistakes, but the navy is all right.</p>

<p>As we swing off our last thought is not concerned
with the bitterness of defeat. We think
of our comrades quietly sleeping on Anzac. They
gave their lives gladly, proudly, for Australia
and the Empire. They showed the world that
Australians could live and fight and die like
Britishers. There are many sad hearts on the
transports to-night. And there are very many
breaking hearts back in dear old Australia. But
old England has showered so many good gifts
on her Colonies. The Colonies will not grudge
this sacrifice for Empire.</p>

<p>Maybe our feelings are best expressed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
words of "Argent," written at the end of the most
glorious failure in history:&mdash;</p>
